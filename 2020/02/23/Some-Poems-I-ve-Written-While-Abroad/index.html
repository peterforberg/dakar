The ceiling collapses,<br>masks drop–the stars implode.</p><p>Do unto others and others will do unto you:<br>learn this message in eye contact.<br>We haven’t broken our trance, but<br>the heavens stare at us still, unblinking.</p><p>I saw myself reflected in the sky<br>and felt smaller than fiction,<br>a screen of my faded figure<br>wavering in the window frame.</p><p>I saw heaven from Row 35, K.<br>It had no interest in gravity.<br>This is all there is to be said<br>about heaven–little interest.</p><h3 id="Untitled"><a href="#Untitled" class="headerlink" title="Untitled"></a>Untitled</h3><p>The God of Mutual Exchange is 1000 mortals running, their limbs loose, to the edge of the nearest cliff, knowing they will not fall.

for the dads,<br>but the homebodies only.<br>A <em>Milk and Honey</em> written in all caps about<br>the proximity to death granted by mowing the lawn to preserve you small patch of happiness, about open fire barbecue grease and the delicate flavors lost to the suds of the Champagne of Beers.</p><p>A song for the dads,<br>but the adulterers only.<br>A “Before He Cheats” about<br>changing the radio stations back to classic rock on the minivan’s console, about sneaking out to buy baseball mitts for your son who’s expressed no interest in the sport, about insisting that, when silent, you’re “not thinking about anything.”</p><p>A movie for the dads,<br>but the gentle giants only.<br>A <em>The Notebook</em> about<br>long car rides with the kids asleep in the back seat and your window down, nine more hours left in the road trip, but for now it’s just you and the stars and the quiet of their breathing.</p><p>A poem for the dads,<br>but the napping ones only.<br>A “Morning Song” about<br>that early dawn coffee, that wordless affect who lumbers out of bed to shovel the driveway, wipe clean the cars, and take in the newspaper before the sun has made itself known to the winter landscape.</p><p>A painting for the dads<br>but the loving ones only.<br>A “Girl with Earring” for<br>the ones who will always allow for forgiveness and never grant permission, for the ones who will, at moment’s notice, lace up their shoes and respond to the call already on the way to your frantic IHOP gibberish, whose mouths are filled with phrases like “as my father would say” and “it’s just part of being a father” and “but what do I know” and whose heads and hearts know better.</p><p>For those dads and those dads only.</p><h3 id="The-Places-I’ve-Slept-in-Senegal"><a

i am fish bone,      i am small things,      i am being there,
  pretty speak.        movement.               the sight sees.
  the sea ebbs,        i wish a lot,           another dog dies,
  talk to me.          the stars agree.        heaven freeze.

i am son of god,     i am run all over,      i am nowhere,
  faulty creed.        panting cow.            nothing now.
  worshippers come,    a lung collapses,       nobody moves,
  falsify me.          spread on thin.         no: no way no how.

i am absence,        leave me alone.         i am pop-up book,
  hand-raised.         a order reverses,       youth-defined.
  dogged pursuers,     an fatherhood.          a picture speaks,
  speak for yourself.  i am on top,            say hello.
