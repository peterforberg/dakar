It’s 104 degrees, and I’m running down hillside to the hollowed-out tree burned clean through by lightning, clean through by lightning its empty husk of ashen trunk is overgrown—overgrowing—with the fresh leaves of young life. Someone says people would empty the trunks of these trees to make room for live sacrifices and then burn them to the ground. We don’t know if that’s true. Adjusting my makeshift bandage, I mount a child’s mountain bike, its seat ratcheted to the maximum height, and my friend stands precariously on the struts that hold the back wheel in place, gripping my shoulders hard. The ground shifts, both feet in motion. A trio of motorcycles are racing down a winding dirt path, women and children carry baskets of dirty laundry over their heads, and I am peddling for two along the banks of the Gambia River. Bloody hand, brake lines out, the road is paved by foot.</p><p>This is Kedougou, 430 miles from Dakar and counting.</p><h3 id="Catch-the-Monkey-in-the-Bush"><a href="#Catch-the-Monkey-in-the-Bush" class="headerlink" title="Catch the Monkey in the Bush"></a>Catch the Monkey in the Bush</h3><p>At 8 PM on a Thursday evening, we toss out our Pizza Time Senior Mexicaine pizza and get ready to board a night bus to Tambacounda, a small town to the southeast about halfway across the country. The station itself is a junkyard-garage-depot at the base of an overpass roundabout, covered in stiff brown dirt and littered with cats who prowl from suitcase to suitcase for scraps of food. It’s a coach bus, and over the course of the 10 hour journey, I will find new and innovative ways of organizing my limbs to avoid cramping. We will arrive before the sun has risen.</p><p>The first station toils in exhaustion. 35 people mill about, grabbing suitcases, negotiating with taxi drivers, and marching off into the darkness. And it is darkness.</p><p>This station consists of a series of stalls with stick walls and tin roofs. Bright blue fluorescent lights are scattered on sporadic streetlamps and hung from trees. The nighttime world doesn’t announce itself; instead, it arrives slowly. The ground shifts from asphalt to concrete to dirt, and new pockets of light reveal isolated scenes. Here a group of men refill bathroom wash pots as travelers disappear into cement buildings. There a man carves purchases into a long wooden paddle, carefully monitoring clients while his buddies joke over an upturned milkcrate coffee table. As our eyes adjust, the scene widens. We glimpse in and out of these pockets of light, attracting vendors like moths. From the darkness emerge salesmen, drivers, and beggars, vanishing again with the wave of a hand.</p><p>A man approaches, “Where are you going?”</p><p>“Kedougou.”</p><p>He nods and leads us to the milkcrate where we exchange some cash and pack our bags into the back of disemboweled hatchback. This is a sept-place, a pay-as-you-come form of private transit that offers discount tickets from garages across the country. There are actually “eight places,” but with one reserved for the driver, seven are up for sale. When all are sold, we begin our drive into the breaking day.</p><p>You’ve probably seen the African sun depicted in movies. As David Attenborough explains the precarity of savannah ecology, a perfect orange sphere rises over long, wide fields of swaying prairie grass. His voice quickens with that telltale curiosity, and you look at the ball of light with equal amounts awe and suspicion. <em>What trick of the camera has calmed its heat? What lens has smoothed out its features? What filters have filled its body with such soft, mellow orange hues?</em> But it is as filmed. On a cloudless day, in the back of rusty 1990s Volkswagen station wagon ripped clean of seatbelts and outfitted with fold-down seats, the African sun is perfectly circular, its edges visible to the naked eye for 20 minutes as it gives the landscape light. Like the intense heat above an outdoor grill, it wavers a little, then explodes. You can’t look anymore.</p><p>I find new ways to arrange my limbs and am given my first ounce of sleep before we arrive in Kedougou, an even smaller town even further to the southeast, the last stop before Guinea or Mali for international travelers. We’ll return to this place, but for now we are searching for a sept-place to our first true destination: Dindefelo.</p><p>Dindefelo, occupancy 1500, is not exactly a hotspot for daily travel. Most visitors live there, and they have little riding on when they return from the “big” city after a day of restocking. We, however, had hotel reservations. But, as Nick pointed out in his sole and luminary post, the Senegalese laugh at that American motto “time is money;” for them, time is worth much more than cash. Ndank ndank mooy japp golo ci naay. “Slowly, one will catch the monkey in the bush.”</p><p>We sat at the depot for 4 hours. After the first hour, we offered to buy the additional seat needed to move the sept-place along. We miscounted and misunderstood. After the second hour, attempts to move things along gave us new Senegalese names and landed us in the middle of a difficult conversation about why we spoke so little French and absolutely no Pul, the regional language. We were also questioned (for the third or fourth time) about our marital status. By then, we had just accepted that everyone will assume that my two travel companions (both women) are my wives. After the third hour and a phone call to the hotel, we learned that the man organizing our sept-place was the nephew of our hotel manager but not much else. And after four hours, following prayer and lunch, we boarded the car.</p><p>This sept-place differed from other sept-places in a significant way. See, the defining feature of a sept-place, really at the core of its identity, is that pesky little number, 7. But this sept-place, uninterested in labels and following trends, held 16. Not only this, but it fully embraced the rustic charm of a decades-old automobile by requiring a team of people to push it as the driver cranked the ignition in order to get it started and into gear.</p><p>To clarify: 1 man drove the car, 2 men sat in the passenger seat. 3 toubabs<sup>1</sup> sat in the middle row, and 3 women with their 2 children sat in the backseat. On the bumper, 1 man held on tight, and on the roof, 4 men hunkered down. If we stick to the naming scheme, a quinze-place is born. Over rough terrain and clouds of dust, our husk of metal screeched and sputtered until we arrived at our final destination. Nearing a full day of transit, we were finally there.</p><p><sup>1</sup> “Toubab” results from a Wolof re-pronunciation of the French word “toubib,” which means doctor or medic. It is used to mean “foreigner.” Thus, I am a toubab. It comes from a group of French doctors who traveled to Senegal for work, and the name of their profession became codified as the name for all foreigners.</p><h3 id="A-Picture-Is-Worth-Too-Much-of-My-Prosodic-Labor"><a href="#A-Picture-Is-Worth-Too-Much-of-My-Prosodic-Labor" class="headerlink" title="A Picture Is Worth Too Much of My Prosodic Labor"></a>A Picture Is Worth Too Much of My Prosodic Labor</h3><p>We stayed in a circular mud hut with a conical stick roof and a toilet, something we had not seen since leaving Dakar (most bathrooms were outfitted with a hole in the ground and a bucket of water).</p><p>I drew water from a well. I woke up before the sun rose. We needed well-water to shower. A shirtless, faceless man assembled trash and sticks and burned a small sun into the ground. He gave me a bucket. The air hummed with hundreds of bees. I lumbered over to the rows of bricks that encircled the ground water. I stared deep. I could not see the bottom, but I felt the bucket gain weight and I pulled hard. It splashed and dirtied the sand at my feet. I let go of the filling bucket and let it swing back over the stone, swaying with no witnesses. I drew water from a well.</p><p>Dindefelo is known for its waterfall. We were led there (and to other places) by an inaffectual guide who didn’t even feign interest in our existence. First, we hiked a mountain to a plateau where we saw fields of peanuts, a savannah, teeth-like rock formations, mushroom-like rock formations, and a cave forest hidden in hollowed out stone. Then we went down to a freezing cold waterfall. I took pictures, so I won’t expend my limited vocabulary describing these places, but I will say, as a Midwesterner, things are more interesting when they’re on a giant mountain plateau. Still, rough on the calves.</p><p>Pictures displayed in the order in which they were taken.</p><p><img

alt="waterfall!"></p><p>When we got back to the hotel, we were greeted by a hearty plate of spaghetti and omelets. We ate with Terry.</p><h3 id="Terry"><a href="#Terry" class="headerlink" title="Terry"></a>Terry</h3><p>Terry laughs at his own jokes before he finishes his sentences. Terry smokes three cigarettes in 20 minutes. Terry lugs around a beer belly and sports dusty cargo pants. He looks at home on a golf course, he looks good for his age, and he looks tired. Terry is a white 70 year-old consultant for a gold mining operation from Australia and he has been stranded in Kedougou for 6 weeks waiting for customs. Today he took a vacation to Dindefelo.</p><p>We first notice Terry because of his thick Australian accent. While I almost always speak English to my friends here, the students on the program have become non-English speakers. When they speak English, it is a non-event. They are not speaking English so much as they are speaking us, the language of the Americans abroad. But when other people speak English, it is a gut punch. It is a siren song over the picnic tables, and it makes my friend blurt out: “Wait are you Australian?”</p><p>Terry is, but Terry is not. At age 16, he left the island to explore the world. While he still lives in Australia for a few months of the year, his true home is nomadic. Today, two Liberian men of identical stature flank him like Indiana Jones diversity-pick henchmen. They speak English but here they do not, and Terry laughs and gestures to them with no response. They barely glance up, so Terry continues his travelogue. Under her breath, my friend corrects his pronunciation of Chinese mining villages, and as he downs another beer, Terry reveals that the New World has been left untouched. He’d love to go to South America, but he could never bring himself to the US. “It’s just Australia,” he says, “but everyone wants to own a gun.”</p><p>Many things about Terry puzzle me. But one thing is clear: this is a man who has lived his life in diaspora. He knows many vague, shallow things about the countries he has passed through, and equally many deep, cultural values about the places he has lived. He is proof of one’s ability to skirt across culture, taking from others what one finds interesting or desirable and neglecting what one couldn’t care less about. He makes and remakes China and Wester Africa in his image: what he enjoyed he kept, but many things he didn’t notice. Perhaps, this is what happens when your primary raison d’etre is the pursuit of gold, not the pursuit of people. This is the distinction between Terry and I, sitting in a small town in a remote African region.</p><h3 id="Kedougou-Reprise"><a href="#Kedougou-Reprise" class="headerlink" title="Kedougou [Reprise]"></a>Kedougou [Reprise]</h3><p>After watching Terry board his jeep, we paid our bills and went in search of a sept-place. Ironically, one was leaving soon, and we were hurried to it quickly, barked at by our hotel manager to pick up our pace. By the time we arrived, the driver had sold additional seats, which meant that once again the sept-place was overcrowding. However, this time, there were not young rural teens willing to hop on top or hang off the back. Instead, a group of education activists we had met by the waterfall, were squeezed inside. As the only toubabs, we stood idly by as the driver, owner, hotel manager, activists, and a bitter woman negotiated seating. After some elevated voices, the woman agreed to give up her seat. As we boarded the sept-place, we watched her wave giddily from the back of a pick-up truck.</p><p>We were not allowed to ride on top or on the back. Women are never allowed, and I am the most toubab of all (with my snow-white skin).<sup>2</sup> They first tried seating me in the passenger seat with a 200 pound wrestler. I sat with one leg in the driver’s foot-space, spreading my legs to reveal the gearshift. This system of reaching between my legs to change gears would not fair well, so me and the wrestler were relegated to the back seat where he crushed my bones to dust, fee fi fo fum.</p><p>Our travel companions found us striking. To travel nearly 24 hours across the country just to see a small town—insane. They asked us questions that few Senegalese had asked before: <em>Yeah yeah yeah, you’ve come to Africa to see another culture, but why? Why here? Why come to Kedougou? Why Dindefelo? What are you actually learning?</em> They complimented and critiqued in turn. First, I was given a new name that means “strong man king,” phonetically, <em>chem-uh-kho kah-tay.</em> And then they pried deeper: <em>why is your French so weak, why can’t you speak Wolof, are your classes taught in English?</em> Like Terry, we were fed Africa through the language of the colonizers and with the privilege of white American university students. But that’s why we came to the country, by which I mean the countryside. To be seen and thus see through the eyes of those whose home we were invading. To become the object, the subject, the question of the local population–to see ourselves through different eyes.</p><p>The interrogation turned into comradery, and soon they were hailing me as the Senegalese Harry Potter and throwing these toubabs on Snapchat stories. When we arrived in Kedougou, they wished us well and were on their way.</p><p>This is getting long, and I haven’t posted in a while. So this is Part 1. Stay tuned. It will likely be the next post.</p><p><sup>2</sup> I want to take a moment to clarify something. I has been suggested that I tan. I do not tan, I just have many more freckles that make it appear that I have tanned when I have not. It is an illusion, my skin.</p></div><footer class="article-footer"><a data-url="https://peterforberg.github.io/2020/02/25/The-Road-to-Dindefelo-Part-1/" data-id="ck71s6qg70000k8tzho5a39cr" class="article-share-link">share</a></footer></div></article><article id="post-Some-Poems-I-ve-Written-While-Abroad" class="article article-type-post" itemscope itemprop="blogPost" data-scroll-reveal><div class="article-inner"><header class="article-header"><h2 itemprop="name"><a class="article-title" href="/2020/02/23/Some-Poems-I-ve-Written-While-Abroad/">Some Poems I&#39;ve Written While Abroad</a></h2></header><div class="article-meta"><a href="/2020/02/23/Some-Poems-I-ve-Written-While-Abroad/" class="article-date"><time datetime="2020-02-24T00:01:33.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">2020-02-23</time></a></div><div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>Peter Forberg</em></p><p>I’ve had writer’s block, mostly poetically, as well as some prose.

itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>Peter Forberg</em></p><p>My nextdoor neighbor is not a goat. He is a sheep. And there are many of them.</p><p>I want to say, in my defense, that sheep in Senegal do not fit the image of the puffy, softly baaing clouds of wool and dreams that Western media presents to its dewy eyed babes. I’ve milked a goat, I’ve shaved a sheep, I should’ve known the difference. But in Senegal, these wool-poor rooftop inhabitants are not light and full of mirth: they are sagging and full of meat.</p><p>Look I hated that last sentence too, but that doesn’t change tabaski. Tabaski, more commonly known in Arabic as Eid al-Adha, is an Islamic festival celebrating the “willingness of Ibrahim to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience to God’s command.” In the highly religious society that is Senegal, it is expected that such a holiday be ritualized the only way the Old God would have it: by sacrificing a sheep. In a market that anticipates the highly religious society that is Senegal, it is expected that such a holiday be ritualized the only way the Old God and Law of Demand would have it: by sacrificing a sheep that you have kept on your roof in order to avoid the increased price of sheep in the weeks leading up to tabaski, which is a summer holiday. Because every head of the household equates to one sacrificed sheep, this can lead to multiple sheep being kept on a single roof, or perhaps one neighborhood shepherd opens his terrace to sheep fed for friends and family. These sheep serve no other purpose than satisfying a yearly hunger, so they hang out upstairs for a while, getting fat and baaing late into the night.</p><p>My nextdoor neighbor is on death row. He is horned like the devil (see, <em>goat!</em>), and he intimidates his fellow pen inhabitants, but his time is limited, and no matter how brass his bellow, he will soon perish.</p><p>In many ways, the city is my neighbor. Don’t think about that statement too deeply, think about it functionally: it’s a bad transition sentence. You can tell that it is a bad transition sentence because I am now six clauses into my next paragraph, and I still haven’t made my point. My point is, the city of Dakar is full of human-animal relations like this, thus I am granted many bestial neighbors in turn. The ways in which people and animals interact in a mixed occupation (and thus income) developing economy like Dakar are pointedly different from Western concepts of normal human-animal relations. For example, people might own dogs, but these dogs are rarely treated as companions. Instead, they are kept on the roof or in a kennel during the night, and then they are let out during the day to roam the city, if they are let out at all. The function of these dogs is purely security, thus they are not liked for their warm, playful demeanors or goofy antics, solely for their ability to prevent intrusion. From anecdotal evidence, people are more comfortable beating a dog with a stick than seeing it leashed and walked down the street. Also, Dakar’s water system is stable enough that most people are able to shower daily. People don’t wash dogs, and they smell horrible. Don’t pet them.</p><p>Cats are free range and rarely allowed in houses. Again, people don’t really own cats, who are only useful for killing pests, but since it’s unusual to let cats into homes, they aren’t necessarily even efficient at that. People might recognize specific cats, and at the maximum leave out a small bowl of food, but such companionships are unusual. At night, by sex or combat, cats pierce the night with loud, painful screeches.</p><p>Birds are good luck and people will feed them with bowls of seed. People don’t keep them in cages, or at least pretty rarely. There are over 600 species of birds in Senegal, and I cannot stress enough how absolutely gorgeous some of these species are. They glide down city streets between apartment building windows, they pick twigs off the beach to turn into seaside nests, and they dive like missiles deep into the ocean. Everywhere they are singing, like sirens or like firecrackers, and they give each neighborhood in the city its own morning soundtrack. Mine is filled with a cacophony of squawks perforated by staccato tweets. Others sound like the launch of 1000 fireworks.</p><p>Moving on. I don’t want to cast Senegal as a country that is alienated from or uncomfortable with animals: the opposite could not be more true. Affectionate, domestic relationships with animals are definitely outside of the norm, but the presence of animals in Senegal pushes the limits on Westerner’s interest in animal companionship. In a major urban area like Dakar, cows will roam freely through the streets, along major boulevards or down tight, sandy roads criss-crossing neighborhoods. Their owners may be dead, or they could be incredibly attentive, knowledgeable of where their herd is heading. One particular herd was owned by something a wizened neighborhood sage, an old man of great respect, and so upon his death his herd was granted amnesty. Now those cows wander freely through the streets, untouched for fear of bad luck.</p><p>Crates of chickens appear on the side of the road, entire markets are filled with fresh fish stacked like cheerleading pyramids, children walk around with slaughtered poultry firmly held by the feet, horses pull precarious 2-wheeled carts, and men butcher sheep on the beach. Animals are everywhere, in every form. Pregnant goats with bloated bellies will one day drop their spawn in the street, and dead dogs will curl up under hot cars.

Now known for its gorgeous views of the ocean, pleasant beaches, and abundance of art vendors, the island’s history rests with a much more troubled enterprise: slavery.</p><p>As one of the last stops in Africa before the trek across the Atlantic, perhaps even <em>the last stop</em>, Gorée became a hotly contested port for slavers, its ownership changing hands between the Portuguese, French, and British many times throughout its days of human trade. And for many slaves, it was the last time that they would be on the continent, kept in the Maison des Esclaves, or House of Slaves, where opportunities for renegotiating their status were bleak. Upwards of 20 slaves were kept in rooms no larger than a queen sized bed, and the “punishing room,” the space underneath the stairs leading up to the merchants’ chambers whose odd proportions might make it large enough to hold one bicycle, held an unknown number of slaves at any given time: humanity mattered little to slavers.</p><p>What occurred at Gorée demands an exhaustion of pain. There are the children’s quarters with slats that allow their parents to peer in, the mixed-race women who took to seducing poor Europeans beneath their economic status in order to escape slavery, preserving their ancestral homeland and wealth, and the shipwrecked masses still being uncovered by their geographic descendants, plunging deep into the gap between hope and history, flashlights in hand. However, this is the reality of the past; it is hardly the reality of the present.</p><p>The Maison des Esclaves is draped in pastels. Its soft red paint aligns itself with the delicate morning yellow of a neighboring building, as do all of the major structures on Gorée. They are painted in gentle tones of sky blue, spring green, and sunset orange, like Easter Egg shells, fragile for the life they once held. The streets are pulled straight from European villas, with wooden balconies overlooking uneven cobblestone paths line with trees and flower bushes that have climbed along windowsills, creating a lush overhead canopy that blocks out the harsh sun, letting in little beams of kind sunlight. Everywhere there are tapestries of brilliant rainbow montages capturing the rustic lives of rural villages or the hypersexualized African woman covered by cloth if at all. Musicians bend questions into lyrics as they strum out dancing melodies on their koras, singing about this European tourist named Jacques from Marseilles that they just met, and vendors of little percussive instruments bellow their heavily accented renditions of “Replay” by lyaz when they hear English being spoken. As we swap coin for sugar peanuts and sweet bissap juice, the tour of the island moves farther and farther away from the history of punishment.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GHyxNW_ZESwUtxEAtcowOxeanG4i4uxQVMR526VWp3RmFddsOwDkjO048pm83MxfkvmwpXy_JspIFMGyaGdyLxYiI_0jc76q_p2hsZ1nbS46e-j7MvAgZQd3wpQGdJgcH8g8i601YxZpvoYH_nQNN_3jdMGnrduQ0riZwtAtkw028V3wyFl6lb3u6rGYuSLLAEHNf2lqpP2zLm_Kj0tiNPj8IjjvyG-aKaC_J41hFvXAlcFC3sB4tv4biL0ACZFjKu7KXdV1Sfw8vPXVu28TDCQYd8q7dBq3eN_FlBdPvOfno3ePufsbN0LG9W1GS_5q-6fWGKq6GTP7XSEYyDT1HhL3RmebFiifnkEdNLgyzG78jlmB2bWDa1ZPxPC1LdQW5XkXYgNb_HjkrdHA1duU3Aa7K-kvEMT4MK2LSriFm-9rDklyCuwCqFIQ48pTBmS0GW4II3tSsecVG4t8SN2714dz2L4Pfmn3-1o3DeKEcm9EHoDLDy6_rgheetbMfGPoKDedWUeGhdaVDGrxfSMFJEI1ziljA9GQWpmQp077A4uTNC9Oz8wjtaxCb89K6OA7w6u0VGgpWE1mcFyi1zqu5QIuGYkLnfHMnCRIqmnM5uZsKN3V3to2BYNZESBMTdHscTMNdaZ1No7ZxOS6b5anD8a3yvYj8fxpIwCYsZdVqv6pAH12tdQWVHq7LcOWZvVXjF7Y-6X0bTPI5BcREhjLf1gXgilyuIbdsJI_1C95aAqN1PId=w1157-h867-no" alt="an ugly picture of the island"></p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2TyrhH0jgnzxRHHQ8h7QltqDDjsJoSzEpZEDQVMbJPiaYTKcLuAMjawPaEFYBl-C86SP2U6d5VTy26wdCY0ODgV0zubKnpYFrKYP_ayKFCxhYyzWwy9dDcvCC5eDSelYg9PbeZBReU_DG-oNUDsPKf-oUfUjrsiyqCiCpSNMCMqP0TEN3hxpx_2gLMEYlEsFbM44iH-vNPfVjvX1BNMnGldA6WRDlAXuUBo8WmFp3j9cWoKk4W-CPihjBcqpim2HY7HS556S3WGvJGewm5t8n3qNTGdl7hNneI7QuxBFM2ZG1vU4rq4Xro2v_uuemFNcS8DXV4f56t1H3LwytmcWmSjRxPjpMd31WHiR4fXf1Eb7QHqkT7gl6esh49o7JObbB6qsEGh_v-obN0BPPtbcxPevWty-54KC3dA4OjR8o_rCv_SJSfj6tqoywh1MvNjldD2X_KiIRvKwcgrgp07__xfkh_cpllK8TUjLloZRznZPIdi1zQ4RheR5Jf8e2xdHQw-7UEXylRgOAk6nViXN_x9hXAZUMaQQItNvEUeEZxxXqshN1uyJ7zCWJUf5QilRibIZ7-qa2sjxCQvhoLmFOyn7xFMI8Igi2HwKD9ZpVI4EMhnTmlyWT_68fLTn0_VaFH0RSi5GYuwuHlw5m7-UOqDl7Kz6b5ARl7U1bO3ERRAXZUg7Q7B1dynZmIlZ_VX__YavJGrcWvMQ_VUxj4EebPsMOGbI4EUrGreHwQlqkAaNYIEO=w1509-h867-no" alt="The island"></p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/i5bANredzcHgIO6QKPsipKB8GBEOwb9c8q7yb3jrAYwYWakSFbXCpFfxvGjgyCj9N3wnoEEQGjWagv1BO0vzVbJGKrsDD6rciRzsI2i8IGv6FHaQIGWfKSkQdJFCfN1pvrfjGRDWkXlduiIv4GOW-jkCoQDrZOeFfjqV2jki0wJ9NpDSHVUj_uzVD0L30Y0Zvzid_d6Ub_hF_YE_aRTpa_Ls04HUqcSF_DSl7-ND01dxAgpQzQRtO41nvZgOAnBNy-84bGNxHSbJ_L4QIpRPfywptufWvCyemqyhXdV7SDbVMqF_qXM9RbYdIBKbCpaDkuIjnzTriAMbVdrM4so2sSfLj4oq96YsuFkVco-snuJb9DajSld2JGXDFIzdAyJCFjOYFdTh5nuUD8w7u6rDJ43bClSD8eafXDkdSw8Qi1S-PMsQPSggzMG37C1D8s8htEZDUUHVs22F009DQa49tRMDz05d6GEXJw4-cC8AibSwEGiZ7cfVZekOsHsq8XhIS8sXOKf8EBLS6nloChQNSPl8gKHnzQyzN-Q12WLAbRcTrLhnwnTDNZbHzuEUJn54kajTMqV95bFK36qyhcO5dj7H8euIyXXflBoQU12WsxOsOw4h0YbBfGm6xxEmnabYkMMXHjwUXvl-BcV--9lOGCCcc6XJmkPn9XHcN5dD6dCBKHbe3X5TPRv_7_jOg1YxYyUDAZ6xfcKD_jKkes7JlB9CiUFrnyxy3VORcoBtU0uy6m53=w1157-h867-no" alt="The streets of Goree"></p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/skpmEKQwg96u9kYi7aWfU1hd6EeKNVfan0bFb6fLoSaVB6V9jhJdGJ_76Xq0_23de_vNx2qFob4xR8NK81gYg4QCQZcvC4vgDbIkQ6p-gGUG65bLBswQVWH9qebLJYb6R1gymBizGmOiJdTQJxjFhJbmBIH9T-r3tjfS-_6o8iZeuoJhH-dU9WSL2rngoUZA2v3EqJkEDTfdHaj6vy5Wryhm-OANl-HjnfRgJU_ZCAEYePGU7MRBfB7QTV7sOEi1a9vrSL3i71MLcehhw0f5RtNOXXbd4pVPXYAl8L6uB-qRE8Bho6GlowgWNBhlKRVBkSd7mOMDIJK9SVFRi1kAPQN5KA5K13oG9PkNWfqz53vRwItLnJr4kJEY5YnB_eUtKvdCkffFVIhwp20lZs1KK8xUovO4eB6EB6osCyrf45bOnVPnZoVpRPznWd4xlV-D7eqWYE8mGWOKDpctQhhsnB6wA06_sCGUY23Q6Va1lrqqGC777HJqNFhLR-yOTe2WQzg94bmV9QD5DsQVHQXCIrvjAJF7rAeEo43P6jThtu3U1fHyncS-FZ4yFmW__8U8PrNAwfX_PJnv83LuJMxPMSc2dTgbd5lqBOZAWggsAMLMwIhsDG4KdvIJlEVC-C7v6SCVj6o4lAq4iluPQ_LFpY44Ywney6l9a_v3cli3Vo5K1tjvkjgLvS5_JF2hIGypFp4fo2dXkJHchu9_46vur6_LeyxL2xEW0k_4LLrNdLI2pxlP=w1157-h867-no" alt="the pretty flowers"></p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0cThxoLwbgZgpcj-T-XZ7uR4ezKPBmWQlFtewGD7iXbNnsZlMEr8H5TyUwl54FeJcrqDb-oGR4On-VVPv90q3jVGfAqgt098IPTW2OtMhkkwaVm9kZKGlluNmHDpxNQMscVwYQ8t17cNsRY1OUDeUl2D7KXBcO76rFUQZziV9AHB-onz2XdG37G0VjfnXSEQHamgzkoaio8x9I0WmG0kOuzfl-1hLV6TuY8RPSHXAeL6MeCDtysTDpuF0G4SR27YfhGR36y8y3vBmHRopgetBY7j0Kp-pmJK9XYL2L4qnWSEmbnPwft1rqy60rCYylP6Oy-8fKNQy-zDQGKEfUp7vfA_4580JWhcJ9vsVbopD4-QrbxUT8F7W-E1CgEj6BMien3xtTeYeVUEcoNm6QnYWKaB-Aqk0IDbJL20pVxuh7m1rffsy5iymLbgM5bSW0bglgD9kbIH5rdl9dOGz80BBKD1euOvN6DGYEvKySvyL0RDcgdopm7vdPhurx2V7LDsM0O9ZDAVZUO0q5O6ycBD-praOdj-HMrfesUjq4vBkIJluhkcwmAnLFdXu_vNEpNrzIptpv4mPZHK3V03Y4-gmRebCyIvnkaUMi-6x9pWmNc_5uhQSSAAF2bNj3LeTvJHrylEHyu4ZJ8yHxcwaZpq9G7LW5HWENfC1HBQck5iZTPxVlv0BNtlyz1L3ZYS01xgrpSd3dW9z4UuXTFHLPYFxbjhhKCUvQJAB9rGMtkbGJU47oJc=w1157-h867-no" alt="the prison"></p><p>“Dignity,” the guide says, explaining how the island’s name came to mean this sense of honor through some portmanteaus and linguistic borrowing. Our professor laughs under his breath and says to me later, “Dignity for who? And who named it that way?” For him, “dignity,” is just a word, regardless of the language that owns it, empty without evidence of its existence. He talks frequently about the power of narrative, explaining how the story of Gorée has been almost entirely left up to a flock of untrained tour guides and colonial-apologists. Even as I wander through the emptied rooms of human suffering, it’s difficult to summon up the same solemnity that I’ve felt wandering through closed-down American prisons, scaling cannons on the beaches of Normandy, or pouring over slave stories in Civil War museums. Portuguese tween tourists take selfies and throw up gang signs, hearts and names are Sharpie’d onto the walls of holding areas, and a tour guide cracks jokes as Europeans line up to pose for pictures in front of a scenic ocean vista, ignoring the former cells they walk past. The trauma of American slavery, ever-present in our daily conversations about race and marginalization, is painted over by humor and merchandise.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jsVcRSTK8TjojtZV-_k9NYuG2fxH3py3bxvFJi8uzfC0kQwKF5432WK1ghfDysuxH9aNngFMcK_5vF4takGIOpWXUTaIkteKxfGjePvKODRtVR5xvOvB8jED3GXcfL-ckqbUnz7f6kq3aUhMketr_Du7duhs8SZqgLvx1lNSSnu0afvqPZx-GZyfV6CPMhYQ_OEOKhcO93Kat5nrN4t7viPEZ49RzAln3JgiF2YkLQhfMAz19CNQMUfK55Uh0VgyPYtrmDTI2iJ332Zcyn4iMhGAi0feiY4plvPhoOPomTAHKZ8BQSl2zZCIx94S6bn1O-E8IOPl8xHjfXfZYcVA6tM0QQLl57JGAWCKzAFy-1iExiMCxMUQIP2LgQ7iBwZCbrLCMgHDc_OgloDOThCYRh21qx8O9ZBnYBRHkRi-jE2RmFoPQ4E2L7FomkcPKz7Bin_apPn9g23f0H1mUqPVaIQI5cQoiQZshXBHEc2fx8-SYulN7imHxwNmW-27r8cJtxApUILffqGh41yYGoyxB-DQyQ8d0IFKmf5LZa1FAjldBfGd6Sx_koajflApXyBOxqpvkOq-gXUQ_MnkxfXOeuTum-iXYzgHYT4jX2IpiX3zDUkp60xdHD9_1daxVQOCvkuO7_6a_bl8uOFUINn36325uUDNwzuW1D_Ddc-OL9TqxvcdP9tqqUqvlhEnRK08cdN2ULBJJ1XA898kwH8R3JeHojX0Y3ObUdkT1-UQPRClSnhJ=w1157-h867-no" alt="ugly tourists"></p><p>“It is common that horrible things happen in beautiful places,” my professor will later say in class. And Gorée is a beautiful place. In its historical niches, there are abandoned churches of old Christian conquerors, prisons for colonial criminals, art-lined cannons for naval defense, and boarding schools that once housed budding radical African thinkers (and one still in operation that might still, named after the deeply moving author Mariama Bâ). Here horrible things happened, where people eat Nutella crepes and dangle their feet in clear blue-green ocean. Here horrible crimes were punished but more committed, where tourists pose in a cheesy heart-shaped statue. Here painters maintain crumbling aristocratic mansions, where slats were carved into every building for firing muskets. Here Senegalese women lost control of their bodies, families, and fortunes, where children sell peanuts and women pester tourists into buying bracelets.</p><p>Here the Senegalese have chosen to rewrite history, and someone like me cannot be the judge of that decision. At some point, a friend points out that she’s toured prisons still in use in her home country, and the cells are even smaller. Coming from a place untouched by Atlantic slavery, she asks, “Why are the Americans being so cautious about offending someone? Terrible things happen everywhere, we just choose to forget about it.” Therein lies the problem. The right to forget and the right to forgive. French honeymooners and American college students don’t have the right to do either, asked to follow the lead of those who live on the island. But while some Senegalese choose to forget, others, like our professor, is fighting to keep the narrative alive, to make the island remember its pockets of horror. What the islanders choose to do with these memorials is ultimately still up to them.</p><p>I choose to err on the side of caution, and I take to heart what my friend said: everywhere has its tragedies, but that doesn’t discount any individual one. The world is filled with opportunities to respect and remember its inhabitants, and it offers a way to protect and preserve itself for those yet to come. Gorée is a part of a complex constellation of human error in reasoning, in action, and in language. It is home to these things, and its existence seeks to correct them in the future. And that is something worth paying attention to.</p><p>The only picture from the Maison des Esclaves is of the graffiti. The round building is the prison.</p><p><img

sleeping weather nor sleeping terms and conditions. We have not agreed to this. I thank my lucky stars for the bat that appeared at 10:30 PM last week and at first seemed to me to be a sloppy hawk. No, it was a perfect bat, with wings as long tennis rackets and a dropping flight pattern that made it primed for the hunt. It competes with the owl for the place in my heart.</p><p>2 weeks ago Nick was sick and I joked in French<sup>1</sup> at the dinner bowl that Americans who get sick in Senegal think that they will soon die. I do not fear death,<sup>2</sup> but now I wake up in a sweat and untangle myself from the mosquito net. Papa and sister are looming over me, having decided that there is no need for overhead lighting.</p><p>“Do you need to go to the hospital?” he says, her “How are you feeling?” apparently not clear enough. I explain I’m fine, just a little case of food poisoning. “What have you eaten?” Pretzels, oranges, Powerade– “Yesterday?” Bread, peanut butter, a hamburger, chicken with pasta. “Do you need to go to the hospital?” I think it was the hamburger. Nods of agreement. “Do you have medication?” I’m fine, again, really, and they wish me good night.</p><p>Buy chewable pepto bismol and always take your probiotics, also chewable. Preferably flavored. Treat your body like a baby while abroad in a country where the food has a grudge. You are a baby, and cuisine is killer.</p><p>If you ever find yourself in Dakar after classes get out at Cheikh Anta Diop University in the Fann Quartier, do yourself a favor an avoid the “double humburger [sic]” priced at 2000 CFA but charged at 1500 CFA from stall #13 in the outdoor cafeteria. I promise you, you’re not missing much.</p><p>Tomorrow the host niece remembers my comment and says, “Now you think you will die.” No, I say, I only have one body and I want to be nice to it. This is the same reason I give to my professor when I miss two days of class. Americans need to work less.</p><p>Down the street is a restaurant called Wonderfood. It sells hamburgers that I will never buy. You tell me if the logo looks familiar.</p><p><img src="https://africa-public.food.jumia.com/assets/production/sn/images/vendors/s6rb.jpg?v=20180309193606" alt="wonderfood"></p><p>For educational purposes: in Senegal, people eat around a large (usually metallic) bowl. Some people sit on stools or couches, mostly older folk, but most just find ways to take up less space than usual. The right hand holds the spoon or fork or torn off piece of baguette used to grab the food inside, which is almost always rice with some onion-garnished protein. The left hand does not touch the bowl or the mouth for that is the hand used to clean oneself.</p><p>I do not think this post is valueless, but it was written when I was empty. I was living for three days on mandarins and pretzels and Powerade. The smell of fish sent me spinning. We have fish for 2 meals a day. I will keep the post as is, for posterity.</p><p><sup>1</sup> I will often talk about Nick in French as if he is not there to my host family, usually my host sister. This is never to insult him. I only ever speak the truth. In fact, I frequently insist that he is more intelligent than me and has better luck with women, which is apparently important to our hosts. Still, he has received the nickname “Karma Boy” for his unlucky streaks, while I have received the nickname “Lucifer” for being a “many face devil.”</p><p><sup>2</sup> I do fear death.</p></div><footer class="article-footer"><a data-url="https://peterforberg.github.io/2020/02/03/My-Body-and-I-Are-Not-on-Speaking-Terms/" data-id="ck66taydt0000f0tzegeqa3mh" class="article-share-link">share</a></footer></div></article><article id="post-Chocopain" class="article article-type-post" itemscope itemprop="blogPost" data-scroll-reveal><div class="article-inner"><header class="article-header"><h2 itemprop="name"><a class="article-title" href="/2020/02/02/Chocopain/">Chocopain</a></h2></header><div class="article-meta"><a href="/2020/02/02/Chocopain/" class="article-date"><time datetime="2020-02-02T17:32:01.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">2020-02-02</time></a></div><div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>Peter Forberg</em></p><p>Chocopain is the newest superfruit. It is the fluoride in your faucet. It is the opium of the masses, water drawn from the fountain of youth, blood siphoned from innocents, the fruit of temptation, the latest fad diet. Chocopain got the entire Senegalese Olympic team disqualified <em>and</em> gold medals. Chocopain was put on the streets by the FBI because they knew it was irresistible. Dick Cheney made money off of it. It sharpens your senses, it heightens your hormones, it makes the arid lands of the Sahel fertile and lush. To bathe in it is to have perfect skin, to smell it is to clear your senses, to know her is to love her.</p><p>Every day at noon, I walk the 20 feet from the research center to the closest boutique and ask the guy, my guy, for a piece of bread with chocopain. Graciously, he takes half of a baguette and slices it lengthwise, then from behind the counter pulls a gallon-sized tub of deep chocolate-peanut butter spread into view, spooning onto the bread one, two, three, four, five, maybe even six endless streams of nature’s nectar. He wraps the bread in old German newspaper, perhaps some extra printer paper from someone’s economics homework, and hands it over to me like a midwife. I pay my guy 250 CFA (42 cents), walk down to La Corniche, and throw myself into the ocean.</p><p>Conspiracy theorists love the mass-marketed brainwash serum, the Coca-Cola that is secretly getting you to vote blue, the newest medication that has the little known side effect of radicalizing youth. In Dakar, billboards are plastered with images of chocopain, the Nutella-like breakfast spread that is a staple in all Senegalese homes. Chocolat by Delia makes a strong showing, similar in flavor profile if a bit underwhelming, while some other cheap brand with a lion as a mascot leans too heavily into the peanut and ruins the texture. Nutella is fine, but it is hazelnut, an invasive take on the spread. Senegal’s trade was built on their peanut farming, so the homeland needs to capitalize on the ingredients held most precious. A taste of Senegal is a taste of chocopain, which has become less of a brand name and more like a way of living. The French can keep their pain au chocolat, this expat needs a reversal of roles: chocolate with bread.</p><p>In homes, empty chocopain tubs of various sizes take on a new life. With their little white handles and easy open lids, the smallest ones can become cute containers for keepsakes, while the slightly larger and deeper size has been known to hold juice for my maman. Outside of my window, the largest size is scattered across the rooftops of a recently refurbished apartment building. Previously, they held paint and tools for the construction workers, and orange liquid glooped about the rim, sending my senses spinning: what was this new liquid sloshing about the familiar tub?</p><p>Some liquids have a maximum volume for sensibility. Take a moment to close your eyes and picture the largest volume of milk you can allow. For me, it’s a kitty pool. Orange juice should never occupy anything larger than a bathtub. Most other juices, at least without pulp, could probably go Olympic, but they cap out at a lake. Hell, Olympic might be pushing it, especially for cranberry. Still, chocopain deserves the oceans.</p></div><footer class="article-footer"><a data-url="https://peterforberg.github.io/2020/02/02/Chocopain/" data-id="ck65b15jn0000ictz59blhicn" class="article-share-link">share</a></footer></div></article><article id="post-The-Road-to-Toubakouta" class="article article-type-post" itemscope itemprop="blogPost" data-scroll-reveal><div class="article-inner"><header class="article-header"><h2 itemprop="name"><a class="article-title" href="/2020/02/02/The-Road-to-Toubakouta/">The Road to Toubakouta</a></h2></header><div class="article-meta"><a href="/2020/02/02/The-Road-to-Toubakouta/" class="article-date"><time datetime="2020-02-02T12:17:32.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">2020-02-02</time></a></div><div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>Peter Forberg</em></p><p>Last weekend, we were given 3 days off to explore Senegal. A friend and I decided that we wanted to head south to a national park on the Saloum Delta. We would stay in the small town of Toubakouta, where our program advisors could recommend a guide and hotel. This is the story of that trip. This will be long.</p><p>Also, hey! I’ve been sick. More posts soon. Including a post about being sick.</p><h3 id="Ma-Petite-Chef"><a href="#Ma-Petite-Chef" class="headerlink" title="Ma Petite Chef"></a>Ma Petite Chef</h3><p>Behind every great road trip planner, there is a small sardonic Vietnamese woman with a knack for bargaining and an encyclopedic knowledge of Trip Advisor. Because this blog is necessarily to be kept secret from anyone on this study abroad program, we’ll call her MPC: <em>ma petite chef.</em> Together, we set out to organize a small, logistically simple trip to the Sine-Saloum region. Our closest friends, like Nick, the absentee father of this blog, were immediately invited, while others were left to fend for themselves unless we suddenly were able to accommodate even more people. We weren’t, but we did.</p><p>A fun fact about study abroad programs hosted at a small research center in which a group of complete strangers have limited social options for 9 weeks: everyone wants to fit in lest they die of social isolation. Unlike in larger social settings where people can retreat to familiar groups of friends, search for new social outlets, or spend extended periods of time fading in and out of social interaction, the city of Dakar locks you into a rigid social circle where acceptance is a must. You don’t have the luxury of 4 years to get to know these people, abandon them, or find other folks. You have 9 weeks together, and you want to get the most out of it.</p><p>That’s how MPC and I ended up in charge of 12 other people. Once word spread of our weekend getaway, the sudden accusations of being exclusionary forced us to expand our troop to include over half of the program. The plan was as follows: leave Dakar on a Dem Dikk at 7 AM on Friday, arrive in the city of Kaolack, get picked up by our guide and driven to Toubakouta, spend the next two days in Toubakouta, reverse the directions to get home. After hours of messaging AirBnBs, combing through Booking.com, and translating our plans to our advisor who then translated them to the phone-operated bus station, we were ready to leave. Hours of driving, boating, and hiking awaited us.</p><h3 id="Kaolack-or-Bust"><a href="#Kaolack-or-Bust" class="headerlink" title="Kaolack or Bust"></a>Kaolack or Bust</h3><p>At 6:30 AM, our small battalion marched from a local bakery to the Dem Dikk station, the morning sun still slumbering beneath the horizon. Unlike the Megabus stops sporadically distributed on city streets in the US, this bus station was comprised of one big sandy lot pulled together by fences where Nescafe carts and taxi drivers waited to greet weary travelers beginning or finishing their national excursions, rows of gently idling buses lined up next to one another with little to no order. Once aboard, most passengers were overtaken by sleep, but for those who stayed awake, the urban terrain of Dakar gave way to new landscapes with the rising light. The red dust disappeared and was now replaced by wide, endless savannahs, tall prairie grass peppered with the occasional low, shady tree. Baobabs cropped up more frequently, eventually creating small forests of those grey, solemn trunks and leafless canopies.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2OAJlTKPklhE1fSF4aj6rCK1HCDOV9Kq4lgb-EoOUDUHXw7UrAG5eaOoyMKE0V84C5_N_W_ZILTKc2XPqWeiTJq8IurnFWNo7Vm9K0ISQmfoF2LGFyzwcyhpZKXfhmnsBQyRwyYag2agOgIt0IwibFkJgmSCII99EYJEMjndZs_2lxt_IxHHEFyX-eyyBYpJajsG31EI3HoXmVdbfjmNVg4iz8lafFG5QeKftzP_30mG6vXjeUEY4325QJGsYRASTR8-ishB5IUobtWKjmiNph2ir84xhMsP4i8vz8muM3j8oHbwiLHxk8OvUtDqNyQr8WSCVMT4JHum96Fhw-DSMDGZc1gIipChXvVzIAIz_2hLI21dCZ3dfYfy8Rz73iy_4KJuzAeDLLdfxvRVyK21SmimX5GfrqFkVmBOkddb2UtW0M2XLHxscpAWugyAXjsHXEYqkjNzcuDW-FxA-zbU4W3cNS0wr2RSyK91MzZOzq_6IfI5AEUWdXA2LYE7SHDcIKu49QvRW-4rr8PKShpyg5Ab9eH8PF8z9LAaiULoaMbnJGEDxImNJp-sVha6XKHHs3OYxt0W_VjccoYkbw4dpDjO6Bb4ra_fwcVRZu9zmkJG4jVTMKEhw9SjrLJoe0D4-idRM3SsIcNuo8LUbYf3AJLhoKajYxanMD8Y5of6JQB6jzf4q-d4MKWTrsJFF7Illk3NuTamJ7TyXcwRpgP5ppexHitvvCVMvav-s2DBRfYvFLmT=w1157-h867-no" alt="some bad trees" title="some bad nature photography from inside of a bus"></p><p>As we approached Kaolack, this vegetation died off, leaving in its place sand pits and small, dried up riverbeds. Ponds maintained themselves with only a few inches of water, and the histories of rain and currents and ebbs and flows were etched into the Earth’s surface. Towns appeared at the edge of the road, mostly compounds consisting of thin thatched huts surrounded by jump-able concrete walls. There were some homes more reminiscent of the colonial architecture, but the majority were just round, one room structures made of straw and mud and wood. Clotheslines connected them, and people sat outside in the winter heat, tending goats and carrying bushels of tinder on their heads. Drifting smoke clouds rose from burned trash heaps, and the air felt dry and empty.</p><p>When we passed through larger towns, they seemed similar enough to Dakar. Though an absolute fraction of the capitol city’s size, the economy of cornerstore boutiques and market stalls were present on the sidewalks; however, the full scope of life was noticeably limited. People lived on subsistence, without cars or taxis or cellphones or WIFI. While there may be concrete homes or pharmacies, these spaces were devoid of the modern luxuries that filled Dakarois apartments. Windows were no more than empty concrete holes, streets unanimously made of sand, mattresses perpetually without bedframes, and even the freshest of fruit not aesthetically appealing enough for imperfect produce. People pulled water from crumbling wells affixed with wooden pulleys protected by legions of flies, while pigs romped beneath horse-drawn carriages.</p><p>The city of Kaolack is merely a bigger version of these countryside towns, equipped with modernity’s ATMs, hotels, and cellphones. Pigs now ran through the wheels of semi-trucks, none of which seemed operational with their hoods overturned, and windows became adorned with curtains or even glass. Brutally reminded of our outsider status, we were swarmed by taxi drivers offering to deliver us wherever we needed to go, and it was at this moment that I called our guide.</p><p>Malang was given to us by our host institution, recommended as a good friend who could easily show us around. However, we weren’t aware of the fact that he isn’t actually a tour guide. He is a university student who lives in Toubakouta when he can’t afford to pursue his degree. He also speaks very little English. After many brief, poorly translated phone calls, he told us to wait by a main road where a 14-seater would appear in order to pick us up. The only catch to this agreement was that the driver spoke no French. In the South of Senegal, Wolof is our only friend. Luckily, we’re not a difficult group to pick out, even in a crowd, so we waited under a water tower where local kids questioned us until a charming short white bus with fold-down seats rolled up, confirming that we were the right people when I yelled his Senegalese name and he yelled “Toubakouta!” As we squeezed into place, we found ourselves on the road to our final destination.</p><h3 id="To-Be-Stuck-Outside-a-Mobile"><a href="#To-Be-Stuck-Outside-a-Mobile" class="headerlink" title="To Be Stuck Outside a Mobile"></a>To Be Stuck Outside a Mobile</h3><p>We were 30 minutes into our hour long trek when the driver pulled over to the side of the road. Here, a man with a notebook marked down the number of people in the car, though there was truly no discernible reason why he should have that authority. A few meters from the bus, a slant tin hut slouched beneath a tree, the only source of shade for horizons. There were saleswomen and whittlers, people on phones just relaxing at this vacant patch of plastic-filled desert miles from any homes or towns in the heat as if this was a fun place to be. The longer the bus sat, the more the onlookers met our eyes.</p><p>Now women approached the bus, platters of peanuts and water bags on their heads. Now our driver conversed with the notebook man, pointing at each of us. Now we politely dismissed the saleswomen. Now the driver turned the key. Now something was wrong.</p><p>For a few fortuitous minutes, we assumed that perhaps this was some sort of routine, a common side effect of long drives out in 100 degree weather with old buses. Surely the driver, like all Senegalese workers, had an intimate relationship with his vehicle and would soon remember its oft-forgotten quirk of not starting the engine. But more soon we were piling out of the bus, and he was lifting up the driver’s seat which hid the engine beneath. Having no way to communicate, we stood idly at the side of the road waiting. MPC and I decided to hike a little way back to a baobab tree to take pictures, thinking the detour would waste enough time before the driver fixed the problem.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2UPGuTn5N3lzZQvDTzyNqhNbapzBV-iaSRU8U7G74ek1nikQZCydzitqFisqUlVOVTLAusYy6GkCU6Hn3Hk0D7GiIVQPOUrRppPp0RsSUmr9pS03_3uo6QIYRc1o0mXeq1pQTlaB1hEpoGaFrv0wv946o2HCjSSejlNlun58WE90hpB_MjDq7ZhxKScwtZS02KeEJXjVnZpDmvmlCxu1ASOsrAkk8sQQTirNat6S_ElkWdiaBCP13DzBkZ6YmDQdrTdEUce6na5xjhUQRZ6TbScv8BRndk17LxOI41VY-O8VknYJXQmdbFrmcpaUbGGQ6fjkW7sE5iPJSm2Od8gdBg-BSiuC-CWnCF_DAxb3z2g2m3GWR0HWW9lLnjJtKzN9WqYEbi5uFMpRfbPTwt-4e9jM4Wd8TAea3Q--SZNbaWZ85NjVPU3Ru1YJ3pKpQ0cHZFIMervv5xL0kS3WFunxJG2sH1bAOB-v25POTyRjhRlkopMSDXJNopXeD65AjeMvUKF07pQCfZMIzt0W-OV8GdhxsfmjMHQ_eybRfBpeeHeZ0hCN6oFxgSTHbZx4W8N0Mu98jiwFtRRxTxksgkBmuNPLi807Y76nkXPEn5AdeNLPGtJzuw9-1NUeKg2fxP16kIEkDvqMp3APRtWWKjhyn1Ate22HjEkGpoIIFQgqFPbF5-kXSp593gerM1U2hGNhYBQoK4eCzZlB-NAJ-F35zQXmTs_rUhrWyrsMr2DMk_4txYm5=w651-h867-no" alt="me on a tree" title="me on a tree"></p><p>We were wrong. When we returned, our friends had all slumped against the shady side of the shack, hidden from the sun. At this makeshift checkpoint, an increasingly delirious group of stranded Americans replayed their favorite middle school games, clapping to elementary beats riddled by memory, digging our heels into the quickly disappearing sand to prepare for offensive attacks, and reciting familiar rhymes somehow dispersed across the entirety of the US. We peeled carrots to be dipped in cooking peanut oil—another mistranslation—and took photos with the locals, who, again, spoke no French and were not gifted with photography. Using my knowledge of interrogative grammar in Wolof and a printed list of verbs provided by our professor, I asked our driver if he could fix the problem. Multiple phone calls and reassurances later, and we had travelled into the brush of prairie grass. One girl sat cross-legged on the roadside, catcalled by a troop of teenage boys who materialized from the literal desert, apparently able to sense and locate the most inappropriate time to display their fledgling toxic masculinity, while another group commiserated beneath what was either a very large bush or a very small tree, talking excitedly as a herd of goats marched through our makeshift encampment.</p><p>In the midst of this midday delirium, we were suddenly all called over to the bus, rushing out of bushes and grass and dust, and we eagerly repacked our bags and bid farewell to our temporary hosts. It was then we realized that the engine was still fully exposed.</p><p>We would not be taking the bus to Toubakouta.</p><p>Of course, no one could explain this to us. Instead, we would pile into a car rapide, which our driver had given the name of our hotel, and ride with rural Senegal’s daily commuters until we arrived at our destination. The cost, distance, and duration were unimportant. What was important was that I was seated on a sack of onions, someone else’s fanny pack in my hands, with a toddler sucking his thumb and wrapping his other arm around my shin, staring at me like the alien I truly am.</p><p>I’m writing a post about transit, but a brief overview of car rapides: brightly painted husks of half-buses, these public transport stand-ins are outfitted with rows of seats or benches facing either the windshield or the doors. In this case, our car rapide was a mixture of all those things. Women, children, and tourists are given priority seating, with some people standing inside, but when it gets to overcrowding, the men will stand on the bumper in the rear, hanging onto the double van doors. The driver is assisted by a man in the back who pounds on the ceiling when someone needs to get off. In Dakar, they take many forms and many routes, but it was evident that in rural Senegal these vans were being used in place of public buses, thus many passengers were women returning from the bigger towns loaded up with vegetables and bread. Packed like sardines, we held children in our laps, squeezed three to a seat, and forced some regulars to wait for another bus to come, much to their ire. And as we neared our destination, unsure of how to finalize things, a motorcycle pulled into view, first trailing us from behind, then dragging up alongside us, until it eventually led in front, commanding the bus to stop. Our guide had arrived, and so had we.</p><h3 id="La-Kora-Le-Chef"><a href="#La-Kora-Le-Chef" class="headerlink" title="La Kora: Le Chef"></a>La Kora: Le Chef</h3><p>Our hotel consisted of a series of cabins enclosed by a sky-blue plastered concrete wall. Named after a popular Senegalese instrument, its rustic appeal certainly made clear that it was intended for those visiting on a budget, which is to say: it was a very nice place; it just wasn’t the seaside treehouse accommodations provided to wealthy European tourists whose hotel staff would collect sand from the shore to fill handmade glass candles in celebration of foreigners’ birthdays. The staff was warm and kind throughout our stay, frequently asking us questions and giving advice about where to go. The boss, Am, quickly latched onto MPC and me as the leaders of the group, which is where she gets her nickname: “This is my little boss,” I would say, “She has the brains, I just speak French poorly.” A fair assessment.</p><p>Later, Am would notice us all milling about a baobab pod curiously and offer to open it. A man of ducked doorframes and second-helpings, we would watch his towering frame thrust the pod into the hard cement, sending it sun-bound until it crashed back at his feet, where he would take a rock and pound its woody shell over and over and over and over again until pith and seed unwound from their tight casing and erupted into the air. Holding the mangled form in his two grizzly hands, he would present it to MPC and say, simply, “It’s not ripe.”</p><p>I’m running out of prose.</p><p>Given lodging, student prices, and perfectly inoffensive Senegalese meals, we cherished our accommodating hotel staff. More than that, we were grateful. Grateful that they didn’t complain when we bought cheaper water from the village, grateful that they gave us knives and spoons to host our island picnic, and grateful that, after a little wine, they didn’t condemn our singing of early 2000s pop hits, instead remarking in the way that only grown men raised in a strictly Muslim country who had thus never drank let alone to excess could, “You all look possessed.”</p><p>We slept on thin mattresses and ate fresh jam. La Kora was good to us.</p><h3 id="A-Hard-Headed-Boy"><a href="#A-Hard-Headed-Boy" class="headerlink" title="A Hard-Headed Boy"></a>A Hard-Headed Boy</h3><p>If this is supposed to be an educational blog, I guess now is the time. The morning after our day of travel, we readied ourselves for a trip to the mangroves: low, water-rich trees with roots that criss-cross over one another, veins exposed when the tide is low. The beach of mud held our pirogue, which is a traditional form of boat used widely in Senegal but familiar to much of Africa and Latin America. In our bags, MPC and I held 10 baguettes, chocopain (a nutella-like ambrosia), and bissap-banana jam. Bissap is a Hibiscus flower commonly used to make delicious, sugary drinks in West Africa. In this case, it was used to make delicious, sugary banana jam.</p><p>Our captain, who spoke little and little French, marched us through the mud into his ornately colored vessel, and we were soon lost in a maze of wide, shimmering rivers leading out to the open ocean. The Saloum Delta is not known for overwhelmingly confusing geography, but at 100F and language-starved, our sudden ascendance into a vast network of islands mostly inhabited by monkeys, birds, and hyenas made the low hanging clouds that shrouded the mangroves all that more haunting. One could imagine the boat crashing into a log hidden by the midday sun’s staunch reflection and being catapulted into the bramble of roots, climbing from branch to branch as the tide rose, keeping bare feet away from the sharp oysters that line the river bed.</p><p>But we were fine, and the mangroves were beautiful.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZwOz51zlV3KLU6ittFA9tp4925_zBtlV2EF0P5SQgDjfl1v73cT4BUZZzIBofNmuCnwqJZWWFvgLc3NO7CZHbonwcOKmpM0MXBLu9l75yA4JFA5TyVWu2YRQ76xnD5O28a_m1nNcHMSmdxxk22NQMbXdOX_uplNsh7vgQyg0Hk3XYwCIJ-qovTPo7SN21ww4CykX1zzSz2bSnRNcWjOL93wN7AcR5AQu8zSbjNS5EAD40YsiKS5biXu0ojjm57HtLBS3ZzIqaadHTjLGxfJptvPLKAMtooMVMFlfgR9ChfE7d8BeIz-WyKv1Bjzz252XsPUvQn-vFSFwOQcDFIp5r_pCoOAdw2gWiltdE3dLcgR9I2QMQVAAXSLDXHQLHlgvaXy-Z6BI3F0-UnNVIfo2o8uwAaxXP0Orx7MJnrpaCpEguSG2KE5lYfHEl808BZDpq3o4wdq56qYn7P14a2nByd5nDSOmNl3AaP_qIvZ0bYzOoX0HskEsXPusVLriBJlKb1LRnV9kOKBttWgig-kZhuwHaqSYgRFyp1ABMyXImvlSbDO4X_X8Q5UDDEYB6DDgUeW4k56ALyh0ottl5GBc5p3Moh-exU-mMmuXHlzEA_uqB5wXY2F74-JYvkrts3itzIPPw1pb7-HLB5cMzjXgTxWESmUrwxf5rw94YArLqn-pOZffA7w50HPOxXFuk874tb3pjdJDRgORk8lhimEeMXZ_5CdBU8BJD4JOR9URQh4QCWR3=w1157-h867-no" alt="mangroves"></p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/U_PvdWfvJMACvn326wZyWH7yv33x_bFT_rDu3h7iL6cFYI_LACWPIhnre8yaqzym7Ar26g4Dtkfjb73oPkNht4zltLZ8ubkC7UwFYUGKQEZlsNVB8BI4B8JSiIuJ67N6HreDGUFcbkGWy_bcijzh7QZWUkd4PfBOreo0VThfasyDfXsv2drapgWwoX8BJe9EO6xlq23NWvI2SVsqbgvAtSZy-_IL5som90shqQXA4VplR3BrTto08HmE6EPf3rQkVOLkYTIXv2cuWotg3-LXSuTdDBemOlBYo7re9XHRfUqJXL2fX4hEHvI_IU_wM0hvNpg1t97gm0Ngb66z1iEhBtig_G9fHmARpQGu64jeGBJ-6mJ3GC-mfh26jvWMhTucW8d6whh0whzEtPinhJJZ43wC15BIIK9bA7wm1NGQNYhQRkkW_X7e1K8wTFnUVM_2Wa9o7YV0lOD9zNiSQ3eksWMJxwlmXcNPX4jv8xD843IHJ2pHgEurTYWw9s1dJQwGd9jOm6U2DL5UlnhK9Ad1zCO2YoxlJE8tGjSUlRQ6wUHZM41kCN3s4oOif4Wz69KvnjlIERDnqHBBXodBH0Tz5Ff_xyicRTpAWNwQlzK5oh5ylF1ts5m1zLvarA-ajDZXT9aiD-BVkNu9MwZEUA4C5N6d_1_Nti9DNtTKFQL_S6ozSfDlERRfm33g6I6sK0A2Cfj0oCbkmfRXrfFMFhHy_RUBB49zLg9eBGi7XM1dxGkdMV-H=w1157-h867-no" alt="more mangroves" title="more mangroves"></p><p>We first stopped at a larger fishing island where villagers harvested oysters and then piled up their shells, drying them in the sun in order to later turn them into white paint, making art to sell to tourists.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UKIVU0cLKjU0mdbiQOyOC8AQwHHDVqDdO0oOx9IKC9NjgJ8Z0dxxLdQ101GOqlkYq1Pya6LmQyAuaTFvax6zq5t9wJJZhkbdfZOXJ-QWKn2I_rVM4DfHebKwDJkKtUUvAQ_puYi_g56wAM__Ammu8OyvQyP1hfB7-hhQyxU9uzNFMJ2-eZGlgsS1FyR_nmwo1g1Q2-oU06aYme2SzWbTRjUCTz-uUw1vmX-5WUK_yAubRIwjtyxhIHpAXVfWDo5jZlgNz7s35D6SCHaSHzkUog6fH9Zad0tLkHRUr1U5AOgS0o8q86grnadW_9GgcP0QBrUhyesb-jVn3-Ckq-_VkJcplN7it-XyosFEDuyDBgJ2jEVxBgpINVanFRJ8a0JVMMn8geUyfA1CxYKMFK_Vc1-OQyChaDdcDYaB_9rYKQaGJ1tKlbu-jp-6viO84_0mK65eIFjvGYDz28mqTS30Zl27-2kge6ibZnAfkUtD2q4vwDSL3axjTg6mPl0axRBXpfRPd8uNkmYT0UUgB3U6gCHuHsLE8uvStdWD8mwQrfjikpFnApEabkPWH-Fu_OPq6_cRU82ZnkO0I8TiA31U5cv9WlagbmJl1HyIRry7DTruA2P_RHD8MzlWWHJDNZLhMG7uXdiB0ic7Iew2aWBc6aCiCxkKYUmowXhKnZ5l2ta9ALWHf7nDq60BiIGDPobWnsDyAwIj0obtjtyH6gogVxje3D3P97z_Q5Iv60bg94et9xEP=w1157-h867-no" alt="seashells" title="senegalese sell seashells by the seashore"></p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FKpsuxuD1MJWxyBMwk5253Ni0gLvSU2KMOp9amuWfq9gFgBhBJjm95Ok_5zSbF9xap6flCAQpKmJZJqSEu_8OH2J_X_A9M3DCMf3qCcLMngkw8mQ_CqNNMj-kYQMg6wmtlt0khZNYODzFNBjNC6TrWxBLiI9-PeVxekoVOtwy_IFqiWNmG5r6wGZ7er3fNl1q2bWaxDLhAmY1LfZ3jFEF828KWTilpP8Usw1TAFLsn-jRok2GWAF0VSo1avdZQcY9z-dieQx48ypyy67vzvWuSDNJgiIE6U53hxOGq8J5ucKkXjMRmrxe0sGbbIDq-PBwHauO5YjFTGRLXgK9HZlw9vG3K1-oR6cw0sE6Iz3EQW1XPH0vzn5miHMfB0tJK6YBoKG3auY8ym-FEMDuX5iYNXthNcaQIU69F8Np5ndrsajkBWJJyW3fBocTsK8wO6gJV9RbHBH5j-zSLnwIry_c9njsTUTt98TZEn13ctzC9HrqMwU9dsFu5vw-_p07G5KSPmpBVlrSjUgz2OZ-KGlrpjhzLlLrnG93IatgSKqGo616XGKz-DLguC2DnplcCa9h_LMl_UVbMqRAcgI0uxVRRfs2bqrtdL8WJTVzCCp8LkmXEDDZ_Kf6lf9BwGIpiPm5Kj4n7ibO9ltL3MUcthTMYbwpJ_vtWK5vbDpo6J8Iu3MyXh-rZTD4PzhOESqpNko_7Fk_1VFWXU9RfqKRr4iwnCaRj-bSb7pAVTWl0QOy70EvawR=w1157-h867-no" alt="oh well" title="oh well"></p><p>The island also had a queen, an apparently 104 year-old woman of great wisdom who every visitor must greet. Every visitor, that is, who is coming from the treehouse-birthday candle-beachside resort. With our local guide, we skirted past the village and swam along a steep beach, eventually making our way into the trees where I would see this absolutely massive baobab (MPC for scale).</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QjvDu_aUTVKmVykF5nJLLIt7hJcWLtPYXi5EBxei6ytsigiAQFKU8ln75DyQqGonGIVyzmLug9FFZxcG1ok9JO3p5i5TGQ7V__aDunhC0NA4ZRmRQq-mLpDQZShwq0iXatKBj8dsFmYdEJJ04po1-9A2zC4QuteKGscjOrytIyP_Mp-Fw3p18CHLgMYy1-Ba7p_ho1s0LQYR1c-E0bOQbkj8pKvZW_N5CPU6JB_PJA_YcyfZtLNosXtQh2r-2EaRvD5-PX-MpXg3UVOJvvHfst7whB6zZ5ExSXvaKjoIp2KmDdOnyCL0X6zKVaitKzs0HqdbK6iBnzl02it3CAdrqPvwaaJ6LHxj2i26GeoX9XltJs_M-KYdE_snsmZ4AiqiZaFsyKG0FSZoTpC15trdmB6ou6ckqfP56w5EaTp_FlANuQ5uk4GvpsZvtb34O7rvwRQlrVaG9IsxqX_hUigk8hg00Ivcba7rWKwZ2Nz4VGHhaYYQ8G0nyd3T4Mayiceti0rJo2_ANL0aVA_-wH65Zp2SR2zEZk36ds6AKp2g1wAQtVRNMUazE4w1N1gPibdicOJSgg-_pfBb_N5We3lQH-j16cCGFZ4mKFkpxcOkAeiXy4_AOnnIVg8EYg3dU36q5w1t0p2bPPN2yrNwZplxZ_2JdF0Fq2T_aC3KEWMvLdlAy-PuW3f84zpkSq1xQ75TsEx2TY4_z6HqchK5_24XKy--HzbANkFPiWiKdB3HFJwD8M1d=w651-h867-no" alt="mpc and a baobab tree" title="she&#39;s like 5 feet for reference"></p><p>Again, we butt heads with the tourists, who were having a fresh-caught meal prepared for them at a seaside patio by some local followers of Senegal’s more laidback Muslim brotherhood. We chatted about the island until it was time to pamper the guests, and then we hiked back to a picnic spot for that wonderful bissap-banana jam. These are the perks of knowing people instead of paper.</p><p>Another perk is that your boat captain is willing to lead you into the shallow waters of the mangroves where the canopy begins to puncture the sun. More than that, he’ll pull the boat into a tight, claustrophobic network of jailcell branches and shut off the engine, allowing the islands to speak for themselves. When you ask if people walk on the mangroves, he’ll say, “You can,” and then you’ll climb over the side of the boat and enter into the world’s most at-risk-of-disappearing-due-to-climate-change jungle gym. In broken English, as you jump from root to root, surprised by everyone else’s lack of balance, your guide will call you a “hard-headed boy,” and while you’re not sure what to make of that, you’ll take it as a compliment.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/N9fkpWRg7IWZM_UiHu0J9HjqBhc5CX1naUuE1xgWoSkqg32l8VczuYX7RNzNbtrpVLtpYRnmJ_siykVAo68uWKnjDHbLu9VPsOK2poH4SQq5lwkfBzTTQJugQq4aMK9JUXcLzUVvUMh5CN4SFeeeYehbSXZLucie3zjYEwNbJNyUKCfKFH-jbOYhiH-h-RI_eVCsBCIiI0AMrDh-Qom4rTmgGAuPJlvT467fNkyUE8cI2Jx7rM-1-HPoCoGVi8JXpndhQeBx4p9oK9T7jNtENC8MSR0nh7swfBEhJZTwtYqdIzAhhJaCTebuO23YnFSjyCxIvbdaaOdSZjyIRTd1XSs5oqoWmvxPgq7uT9MkAefVCbJ72YBuJudaXU3f1cDFxMV1LXypRBq0ERJemLbTnmfi78ONVuCtc0oc87EzghHEDctLQ1gJ4kzBTwDvQeXI0PnxjKRJe8cey3ozghCuE9w3V8nY2tfygttvhU2LqUWmpHCvAoKRrQPW_Gzi-HqjT7N-Yy6edr1sFidq3rqvsSSB3WV6CgWCklgPXsgHCuEBURqcE9QTtjbr6md_Dc5MHweCOd12-N4MsWvCAlOzviyrN4yv_ZTrZ66okeEwB6WrV7G2O5CM6xJgjxxL4yumEO_585ZdA-tMo_V5A1GJom4-lVaZ7OrlkSo8X210UElz1gOgeewaQ1jy_VQq1CiNCIToF0KVe0MRf906F-bDR6I5R2aEEpV5Ifm08YYzT4tXsv64=w651-h867-no" alt="we&#39;re on a boat"></p><p>At another island, this time made of seashells, we disembarked and were led down a shell path through a thick forest of baobabs and brush. Mounds of dirt marked the tombs of kings, supposedly buried with riches now protected by dark spirits (and UNESCO). A sacred baobab split down the middle made for the perfect hiding spot, and MPC collected her fateful baobab pods. There’s nothing else to say about this island other than that it was perfect and heaven.</p><h3 id="Papaya-Jam-Just-Tastes-Like-Baby-Food"><a href="#Papaya-Jam-Just-Tastes-Like-Baby-Food" class="headerlink" title="Papaya Jam Just Tastes Like Baby Food"></a>Papaya Jam Just Tastes Like Baby Food</h3><p>On our way back we saw a big beautiful bird, a seafoam heron who ignited his wings on our approach, and a monkey who played in the mud. I took no pictures and have few words.</p><p>After a break, we went to Toubakouta’s annual festival, a celebration of Senegal and Gambia’s friendship that invites local villages to come perform, sell, and eat together. For those who don’t know, Gambia is a funky country tucked inside of Senegal, a result of competing colonial powers. It exists along the highly resourceful Gambia River, and it divides the southernmost part of Senegal into two regions: Sine-Saloum (where we were) and Casamance (where the State Department will not allow us to go).</p><p>The merchants had a wide array of products ranging from street standard (like peanuts and dresses) to local grown (like bissap jam and special dissolving green tea). I was torn between a grapefruit and papaya jam, but a friend went with papaya so I made no choice. See heading.</p><p>In Toubakouta, while everyone speaks Wolof (the language), not everyone is Wolof (the ethnic group). A large number of people are Serer and thus speak Serer. So for a while we listened to a Serer band jam out in Serer, a crowd of people politely leaving space for passersby in the street, until a wall of activity blocked off the road behind us. Malang stood his ground and commanded me to tell everyone to stay put. Dust was being kicked up into the air. As the song wrapped up, the people on stage began glancing backwards to where the commotion was taking place, eventually giving up and turning around to watch in stunned silence. Officers and soldiers pushed us to the sides of buildings and entered the fray.</p><p>There was no shouting, only footfall. A ring of people defined the circle’s interior, mostly young men, and, with hands on knees in athletic poses, hollering from time to time, falling and jumping and climbing backwards into the crowd to escape the movement. From the outside, one could only see a massive wooden spike adorned with hay and charms bowing and bending over the heads of the excited onlookers. A spirit, a creature of the savannah’s grass and straw, had appeared in the crowd, and with defenses high had challenged the officials to combat. This was all staged, a fake showdown between nature and man. The creature was a living haystack, 7 feet tall, with no discernible figure or form, and when it moved, it absorbed the spike into its mass, then somersaulted on the ground, appearing like a live tumbleweed, a fast-motion hurricane, a spinning top set loose from its string. It kicked up sand, tornadoes of it, and sent the whole crowd into a fit of coughs and covered mouths, teeth dug into the sleeves of forearms.</p><p>From outside the crowd emerged new rivals. With costumes similarly made of shaggy colored grass, these had forms and faces, a massive gorilla of jet black hay with a paper mache face and a rainbow suit meant to represent the birds of heaven. As they competed with the grass in rounds of dance, little skirmishes cropped up at the sides of the circle. At one point, two completely orange beasts wearing the masks of demons entered into combat with a woman in red, both parties made giant by their costumes, and they would clang massive machete knives together and beckon to each other, pushing one another to the perimeter where children would scream and flee backwards, but even adults would recoil and make space. There was a palpable, playful fear.</p><p>Soon, the beasts of nature vanished, and instead a gendered dance took center stage, wherein women would come forward and, with knees bent low and arms bent high, kick up dust like pistons, their ankles shooting straight up in rapid relay. The men would counter with their own dancer, and a duel of affection played out in flat-footed flashes of drum and rhythm, pounding each other into the ground by sound and motion. Someone felt sick and we left.</p><h3 id="Seeing-the-Birds"><a href="#Seeing-the-Birds" class="headerlink" title="Seeing the Birds"></a>Seeing the Birds</h3><p>The next morning, I woke up to see the birds. Sitting on my cabin porch before the sun had risen, only a few pilots cued their morning songs; instead, the world was burdened by a loud, low hum of hundreds of bees collecting pollen from the abundant flowers.</p><p>By the time the first signs of light touched the canopies of nearby palms, an orchestra of birds had started warming up. They spoke stilted, they spoke sweet: they spoke lilted, and they spoke meek. Overhead, large birds of prey glided over the small town, doubtless heading to the river for early morning snacks, and in front of me an array of intrepid craftsmen took back the trees. Bullying the bees, faux-hummingbirds overburdened by fattened wings and plain beige bellies hovered in front of flowers; meanwhile, some long-beaked, pear-shaped songbirds flew into the tops of palm trees and bit down hard on the tops of those tall leaves. They would flutter for a second, trying to clip a spot in the veins, and then let their wings stop, plummeting a few feet to pull a single, thin strand of leaf loose from the full form, an ingredient for a nest with which they would triumphantly fly away, back into the orchestra.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Zq3CwfUlCJIZGzW4NpbUYnblzyMNOu-KUITFGa0jU-_Rp1FdibdJiKdH8fp_Bnzk_pEWoiKDza6S9UOrWhytofoR8ite8qeVyXltvNM9asmdMsbC59gu-msdf9uwuVgLwYdqUTf0RO3gbsbqAUfQq4UwMGOZUnNH8Zu0qhxJGHTEubogDO406H26kzZWrLFURN1q8RCeQLKmFomhcnTbhc3YOMF4wz6h4p2ULqC5NT6cExIk3Eai3-ap_abJjM1NAbej_oCtZ5WLEMU9omX08M1bJHImt9gpEH1z0kVZwKTsix-qpAGhMvjslUt0M6gzcCWrIpJ4MnsCtCuJHFLwhRXna-mwICCsnbrcB3ta-FP4Ve7h0TI2Iufy-re4v8QEQSyox7M6_JLUFqBAdTkSsIVC0ciIXRPM__e42L5YgXnfPuswkl-Kf5Milrq9bsFR3u0OQ27ieel6auOs7T0nZRcURmQetcohP-dcZhJMGv995x-6ACGaHCUk23Ab51e9-GP0sNKGlN3Pqw17PCNT1d2aV8KQ99XF5QaguaMq_341AMz3A2mKysHzX6_z4-9YQGPqe4-BfRR4550A2s7zMJC9RQul9wpxLHV1sPA0A4hAnqaBa0HCgNCnvyQwSXCJwlgAqQ1AF5V2LYhU0QfaCTHkwOmUEof4ehHrcO46a4YvSRs1od5tCRpfmmeGhAFtKdUglbmA5WNwxl6uXzlpvjgLGeHvmOZOnKQKfv0iM5qMoovS=w1157-h867-no" alt="only the lonely"></p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QeveEQ1k3l8FTim2czPZ-WXKKYrbxpcPVpdMN6uKV4yBlleMNzH8adHV1BPmYuU4yRrY2nsnMBVPZjEmDA1BFutJrkdyONSRqK6g88p3QpJfs8l21P1GXDW1ESPEW8DbVoaAM6sNiGbxt3Bd5haVNyTerpaAV4aTpQ5ruO9sndnWk30rpIjH4ezev1XctphhM57YDVnD_6lpGtbCCm7hZDz9NV9aGsY09m1ifN9xn354BsRALpOUnXQqTBb89PLDDELhAATKYZDVvxjzxDINsa7iyH_nCIkvUwnnpZRd93vKt_pjg1lwd0g9f0uOxLERtwFlXFim-F4pDA_y5SixxfiPOgcObSEoEN18-CJSCoW_qjUQp_liGEwI6A_BSgzYBK9bLuCETJVojVPuPygDk7eMlIv3OLPzfke0ptF4rXqSF0eGjZ_2cU7L5P6YW5b-XUgL1LBDLZcQ7FIj4Od3R_vPlV4nMZqBF7iIMD7l6TY8Gjt-pXj6bUzP9c2k6PzcFV12izwXaS95EaY3e0SKbYl9P4S9JyMWuL66wF47lTKdImW2OT_YToRspGrpRuOlE4EkODh11W85rNQ5xJgVWE6ln8t50Ohza9Y1te1JrYvAcJTNSxMinXNSDJRtujAeiJ4UXWiCKYHFQJwLxdfLUG5cFhQ1GcBAg69EI7tt4A_RlPGOe9tUOCKc6vriefV-Dw1DHcD1XKAvn2Tc4TYtkSg7BCKkk_pVqKI_-L77U-v59_7n=w1157-h867-no" alt="he pull"></p><p>Deep blue onlookers perched on top of buildings, and chickens hobbled across the road. On wingspan, the colors of the sun were carried to town in order to set the day in motion. MPC and I decided to actually visit Toubakouta.</p><h3 id="The-City-Redacted"><a href="#The-City-Redacted" class="headerlink" title="The City (Redacted)"></a>The City (Redacted)</h3><p>In Senegal, a commonly held value is <em>teranga,</em> which means “hospitality.” People speak of teranga the same way that Americans might speak of democracy or justice: more than just an ideal, it is present in not only the nation’s travel brochures but also in the way that people live their lives and politicians make their pitches. People want teranga to be true.</p><p>While I am frequently given the tourist treatment, the general conceit that people here are overwhelmingly friendly and accommodating is noticeable. On the beach, strangers will ask about my work or country of origin, and soon a small crowd of random folk will be locked in conversation that slips from French to Wolof to English and back again, joking and swapping stories. At home, guests will refuse to visit only one person, insisting that everyone joins in the conversation. The man who I buy bread and toothbrushes from knows me by name, and if we see each other outside of his shop, he’ll make sure to say hello.</p><p>And so I wandered. We walked into town, past the pregnant goats milling about piles of burning trash, over the fleets of chicks stumbling after their mother, around the tourist trap market stalls adorned with authentic merchandise imported from the same seller as the ones in Dakar, and across the road from where the lone police car guarded the slumbering Europeans. We entered the back passageways of concrete homes unpainted and undecorated, the overgrown fields of garbage and reckless brush, and the clothesline mazes of wooden huts. We were greeted with “peace be upon you” and “how are you doing?” until we encountered a young girl and her albino rabbit tucked between a few houses where men were whittling and cooking. I asked her, “Is this your rabbit?” and she replied, bluntly, “This is a rabbit.” Awa and I talked a little in French while MPC took pictures of the bunny, the first we’d seen since coming here, and then the men became interested in the foreigners conversing with a little girl in their backyard.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/18tfonciWEbEmH2RGWwab9C8bWD6L95SRTNyuERB8ay8euuFKZgvh3WDXLUGm5wF7ZZVefUoPRc3RbteGJvUNBssyeq7wiez0pYc0tt69bJHqyW37ZJsbXUFXcQP-j1PwfR-FvkMdsEDhb67noQyrkNSgOSnI1wjI3fJqkz-MXCOfw-dGQWk6AR1A0KoPUjDw2YoiVkdtSQ_2EbR1IElFngNTcNNQot4kyIZ3n3s-ChGeEj0uGy0h0UOpXjgFTCEpjBnlSdWDFmdRLtnVuc20Xg35j-pvG7iMpTbfmIF-DZEFqkCCa56JK0fG68bHzeXNXZgUVq_I3n9XJcA-tWiQ6BRTt4WwcacboU5d_esVc66mBK14FSnpOY6kZNfqDAnOupwAsthugx6ZPyBzgBUYX5nXGXAkosWLa5kCmdRCKofH06ii8-Dtm8sHXlqJTfe0jrZpCWlUYYBB08bCP_YHm8gHGar2hTjuf0CF0_gGiHgucN3j8P8rydyxQQ-9pThWqrarfPkNRA70ORT5mULkrNs1OnkwOb6ftCEKUX0iz5CngaARinb70SlJ3lYMvYMhyTxhROAD7YKwnG-VigJaY2pFIEReiNNIgLS9paUpFHpL3cVshjDz15MxY4MjrSOrR06x0DwaF1kylrZOurWfH8ZsAHFWTtqFF-TR2HaraAUL_ap0Ayd0TyDuAWEpwsveBjtKjPFQThvb4-rkAUBQvKYSqk9u-GfOz13Ho4Ijj3HN-uc=w1157-h867-no" alt="a young girl&#39;s rabbit"></p><p>I explained that we were students staying a little ways down the road and had just gone for a walk. I mentioned, protectively, that we knew Malang, a local who lived around here. At that, their ears perked up.</p><p>Another fact about Senegal. You have two names at a minimum. Last names distinguish ethnic origin, and there are only a dozen or so that one commonly hears. First names memorialize family members, and there are maybe 30 or so that one commonly hears. Sometimes, first names recall multiple family members, which means that people have multiple first names, and sometimes, people want to preserve their ethnic history, so they keep their maiden ethnic names. Thus, full names are often 2, 3, or 4 of the most common words you ever hear in Senegal grouped together. Fatou Maguette Fall, Maguette Fatou Kasse, Awa Fall Diop, etc. What this means, ultimately, is that <em>everyone has the same first name as everyone else.</em> Once, after meeting a man on the beach, he gave me his full name to look up on Facebook. It garnered hundreds of results, most without profile pictures.</p><p>So when I said Malang, they immediately pointed to a house behind us and said, “Oh, Malang!” Someone said something to someone, and in a few minutes, a Malang, but not our Malang, appeared in front of us. We said hello, and I joked, “A different Malang.” “Oh!” someone exclaimed, and pointed to another home, at which point I started to describe our Malang, who was notable for his university education, and they quieted down. Had I not, we might have become witness to an endless stream of Malangs, each equally uninterested in knowing us. With an awkward French “We’re just going to be on our way,” we bid farewell to the rabbit and fled.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d4Y9FpX7zyJ7z7Z10zVmw62a8CVhcUq-wv-jp_-cNamdM5F73pIof5Dz50Nxjf21IpYPzcgRTTJ8nr9TE1heI8I5G4WV5p-FPKDNGsu_lgyYJGpZahIrVo7SDEf8jz9r726kBK6upnQhRiTR9zjKi5piCSr121aW6jyNi2Cag1EzVeQ7aYCqgeWRDuPY7gwbnmypUlsZadWugi03qpsRhVTN2xlrdXoewA9M17TJhyzT141ELfL0-SNNRP5wKLmwcdhUz2z3OOhT4Cn9m4J5x9Pu__fS_3j9bj_vGcAozN_O7I9MtKfWNkITro3Ia1pLZ1RjZYaqFVoYT00sLgf0XCkMcu3CfLHfLdzmJJHU0FyqqkSlhhUmerAw46s3PE7OcZH_HDA6zbQ_ZAMugeW244vQwWQtqItb7PuAWxrQZxvsSKZ7c03JsNbqh-erbtDBz_QqonYsiKqh1XFoWUm6hW1PDoN72Bg4Y1Tdmx05FcZF_bhIZjb0emazvu4FsVPV5wkPAVmaju6jN1z_NbfToc3R-TLK_9UL-GUPhJme7FAHAbEVdrAq9QfjZAMn096h7g1kv-VawIbpqKspaLiRb_IYy_Fa2x1Y3Z_jhvvlJ7KqUY0rfSYf-KfxQDHJqUgpXnHqG17LBi7WI0JjJAP5PKsCGaMS7cDff4x6535L_NOpE6Co1S20zapVaj9rVtZHkX8lCL6rY_yxrjARrtbCmRMfb0cEEnan7hp93C4dYpL97Y6Z=w1157-h867-no" alt="goats battle" title="i bet on the losing goat"></p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gxXrjGALSedJNzs7JPz8uJxmqCVVJXgwdqnXzuieB2SgDrDMchOgGsLheouq_Xw0O59OkygtwxLhvjnJsjIfEaEO80oDiH3-zgQriyR6kEBrqfrtSHixSLbcWXbZ-IkXEBzIenk7vhSlCCEZjUWpxLNhzpoO3LQQrukyLLO2s-zcQ9x-q4h_eYa2exyzr8hdgQqquCRbaLKB1ySAZqE5cga4v_-x40CCVPxmGMRnw4y0GxrllfakPrHBC79ZlYqzvYLMD1MGM32VVy2kd1gRb1ypQwQFYQqhmzxE8VGc1fFKpsjLxzOS6fFRsjcaKWR74xtP6VaSCetZkGbjQYUy7xAWx2qzUU-UvQoXmBizK1_OqloIp2zlRSeWB9o7iW9L_NYUBOT64W5TDdkGnpsu4hfZRK6-HDeB3QXTpBn-RK43GTK6OF1D3rZhWI7JFuzsPlA4LRluPmMwrMJoWiwQC0uEVu5tr3g7ZB3B1Dss-5mKL_RnmG0QFHIjGneTSQLVb7h9MONBGL7oc8UXP2njKhpeHkgV8Q370grH-EYvpXdyi6b0SrLtMSD6dqLDiFDt1ufgl30MrEsfrVq6N5oIuuz9ZF7nhBjBZQMzElLEFAgbrqByrKYYKhhSrX9Aqfr9zhyGF5SAf7m7yHnPVJ5tK-l15l0XpLyCotoL_vyfX6qRD8N2Yo5pXj1CYdFhldyoajuM4idvCM6rXcvia4FAAzWOK1XxEI4ELml4XkKE0yJOQIML=w1157-h867-no" alt="battle continued" title="i&#39;ve always been for the underdog"></p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/U2R2zaoZZiDHOkLKk6O3TIxzzkVOIekM5Ty3zv9YYw555dow19Zv-b-1xjPk6FgJZx7JHGCjq446dBNRE-nntO_5PLIlUQk7Fz_VXuWNIV_CgEmPFwZaoFV0m0Wd7Dp4pJgQTwQrw659NLp9QB9Ow8-UFWKZwynG902nr5ya5pOw_Y5dtuD99Xm1gvhJjqNbY-YDflsSI2PtLjWPkb-UFrcixXNIGmh-bcftqLQKZOhy5hUvCI0y_NdbNubmx_0RJr00RtW0ycZohSXDPE_vkWk-bNMV1YOI5weTJnBaEFY3SXe2QqO5jvLKPDDLfGdKboykqxY1JrpyvY0qfTQyPwgBhUAwtmgP_OJTKK8JDleTRVunvAlvMMieb98VzkOKPUZSFpkCzWUNy3ZzMGS8Ny1SH0uWsLvPP602IKNXFOAye2PHbVYnF5PztyTYLqGdX4NnqxygMTF9Vk0lpyP-fBiK_xj5aE_oU6JEym8zK3r9MQqfvY33PjMDSwG6n41Bn5-kT8oVgzS6xA_GsaJO6bm2Or7D3aNwRRIj6VXPHwxGosEIuK1dVo2Gm6u-XnvYeibKRw_zCtd2O3xPcjdQgD7XM9YMquRQvMg8YSog_bSsLWAyFkY0pd0zQcB5Y0nTP6TpJqiOMRnu5TgjpakI-PQElQhreCDtaBfKcCHvNpuaUuvN5rL1DZvpN68_yzwLeNUb1EGFSeqPtDPoiU-PZ3uGmfdQrBtHxntNHcH2YUU_6XFt=w1157-h867-no" alt="the saddest donkey" title="the saddest donkey this world has ever seen"></p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KChPELckAOwzV6KGgovKvjvsP7WVSTKJF838Lu7ehjhHFaDfYKZ9Pf1k9Vq136ZR2UXE8gorKiXtpn4ONBpzFwI5YEONzWLiLP1JrEQglDrOtUF4Yaa-reUkbzLlWeHu5hG7hJdGFVqMCt8nCYjAxXVxstpdwMUhgf4k8qQhcBq902iVdR-BQr-bzyl-Zv0BT-pbsfRS1cWJA7gr34vdy08S_lZqdjPaAjB_iWYfrBtSc_3M7g_FRmdaWYepZIiCN87TUA96jVA2NwSmjPn1-AQfgQGA36SG7ouKmW0oxEe1G7GwC3DkXp-zbYZobySppcZdb4tuOHytLufb87V3UxcAViIKc1j7KpTGxG8QO0M2wrsRL_YhBvxU0YYb2yx_a4cNYUW6Gqab_A_aowLMYxHzPqBVjK7g8JYxsHLMlqwFXTcXU8LtlZt2wEVWj-NhwcvXTZo7wG7UJDxqVMusats29jSeXpFLRCxSFp4kqsI1pBA1YYqO6NkJ3eNn21OeWNnGhDDvkmXBhIcNQSIO0mDQXRZhB3tsXZPl-Xjp_tN39wYAhVsOiLcSg2WnXQ4jIlhydMely2W0I9AVr0D6c9rm6Qx-h2Gg-6SN-KFwjcqOo5yYdXPhghtyjr5f46bW8WuIpOOZzGS5UJp2i17SfY8RJxp9j-6C5V0Bdccz9XrrKOB1bQAoDZOSmDSAtZIruzLnUWbOzUCgfkKYYuc-Oj_QcrxqGZB7aL6Tf6jE_-KT8MRC=w1157-h867-no" alt="some old houses"></p><h3 id="There-is-No-Authority"><a href="#There-is-No-Authority" class="headerlink" title="There is No Authority"></a>There is No Authority</h3><p>We took a bus back to Kaolack. Luckily, there is no story there. After paying (our) Malang, packing our things, and saying goodbye to our hotel staff, we piled into another 14-seater for a short trip back to Kaolack. Again, we were stopped by a random man in a robe who penned down the number of occupants, and while this would happen multiple times, no one would explain why to us.</p><p>When we arrived at the bus station, which is not where we had originally been dropped off, we found ourselves at the base of someone’s apartment building, someone who presented himself in a yellow and red track suit and drank from a coffee mug.</p><p>In an upcoming economy like Senegal, distinctions for legal authority or occupation are really uncommon. The only people who wear uniforms are police officers, the military, and fast food workers at Western chains. Otherwise, people are always plain clothes, always relaxed. The only reason we knew this place was the bus station was the bus parked outside of it. Otherwise, it was just the first floor of a man’s apartment building. Across from his office was a kitchen, and in his office was a mattress. Random inhabitants entered and left, and we took his fancy handheld ticketing device as proof enough that he must be the guy in charge.</p><p>I slept on the bus ride back.</p><p>As for us, there is no authority. After organizing the cross country trip, dealing with tickets and hotels and translators, and navigating the trials and tribulations of a French-less casual economy, I immediately took a wrong turn as we walked back from the Dakar bus station to our respective host families. From there, MPC took the lead.</p></div><footer class="article-footer"><a data-url="https://peterforberg.github.io/2020/02/02/The-Road-to-Toubakouta/" data-id="ck650i56v0000m8tzcx8y4k4a" class="article-share-link">share</a></footer></div></article><article id="post-On-Kids-in-Cars-and-Cars-and-Kids-in-Cul-de-sacs" class="article article-type-post" itemscope itemprop="blogPost" data-scroll-reveal><div class="article-inner"><header class="article-header"><h2 itemprop="name"><a class="article-title" href="/2020/01/20/On-Kids-in-Cars-and-Cars-and-Kids-in-Cul-de-sacs/">On Kids in Cars and Cars and Kids in Cul-de-sacs</a></h2></header><div class="article-meta"><a href="/2020/01/20/On-Kids-in-Cars-and-Cars-and-Kids-in-Cul-de-sacs/" class="article-date"><time datetime="2020-01-20T15:14:22.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">2020-01-20</time></a></div><div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>Peter Forberg</em></p><p>In elementary school, we’d often take field trips to <em>Chicago,</em> the big-city-far-away place that meant stuffing our labeled brown bag lunches into an industrial-sized green plastic bin and splitting into groups to explore places like the Art Institute, Field Museum, or Shedd Aquarium. If you were cool enough by charm or lucky enough by assigned seating, you could end up in the back seat, where an easy way to pass the time involved waving at the cars behind you from the window of the emergency exit door. Here we played rock-paper-scissors with commuters, fired fake guns at drowsy travelers, and begged for truckers to blow their horns. It is with this carelessness, this excitement, and this curiosity that children are allowed to engage the world and its inhabitants, fueled by an unbridled friendliness that can forget about the lack of make-believe in the real world. They’re allowed to be kids.</p><p>An especially rewarding moment for me was driving down the Dan Ryan behind a school bus and watching as kids on the bus armed themselves with finger guns, shooting at me as I tailed behind. I feigned death, clutching my chest, and, because buses drive slowly, moved into the next lane. The children, stunned at my participation, ran forward on the bus and reappeared at the side windows, now aiming their pistols into the open air. I played back, taking a few potshots, and then accelerated out of view.</p><p>Another day, a few months later, I found myself waiting in the deli line, ticket in hand, at the Jewel Osco in Woodlawn. This time, two kids sat in a shopping cart outfitted to be a racecar, with fake steering wheels mounted to the plastic seats. They swerved, leapt barriers, and avoided traffic. Soon, however, they noticed me, and, as the little boy said, “He’s white! It’s the police. Shoot him!” Again, I found myself in a duel, but, knowing my place, I let them gun me down and collapsed to the floor of the Jewel Osco, their mother appalled at my decision to take part in their game. But they laughed, and the little sister was happy to have been a good getaway driver.</p><p>In both cases, the children were black.</p><p>Now I find myself in a predominantly black country, knowing for the first time what it means to be stared down as I walk the streets at any time of day. Sometimes in Chicago, especially in places like ALDI or Jewel Osco, I’ll get a few looks, even a few comments, but ultimately, the people there know that they don’t live in a black country. My whiteness might be unwanted, but it isn’t surprising. Here, I am a surprise. In the same way that most of us students are surprises. Asian students are greeted with “Nihao” when entering into marketplaces, while I mostly just get asked for my country of origin. Still, most of the time, nothing is said. Instead, people do double-takes, point and stare, or take photographs. But not children.</p><p>Children are amazed by us. Recently, the lot of us (who are mostly not black) were packed into a bus and drove through the city as school was let out. Kids on buses screamed, opened windows, pointed, and laughed. Kids on the street stopped to take pictures. When walking down the street, kids in the backs of cars will follow us for as long as possible, moving in their seats to look out the back window and watch us disappear. At a concert, Nick held his phone out into the air, recording the stage. Little kids pulled at him, and one tried talking to me in French. “People will steal it,” he said. If we talk to them on the streets, as they will sometimes ask us how we are, every response, no matter how mundane, will be met with laughter.</p><p>And kids are on the streets. In a forthcoming post, I’ll talk about how this is often not a good thing, but for the kids who can choose to enter and leave the streets as they please, the city of Dakar is their’s for the taking. Growing up in a cul-de-sac, I knew the fun of having a big open space to claim for yourself, but there was a clear line of demarcation that separated the world of children from the world of adults. In Dakar, that line blurs. Children roam around concerts, hang out in stores, build soccer arenas in alleyways, town squares, and streets of sand. They hijack mopeds, heckle tourists, and play on the beach. They are wild, unbound, and hopeful. And so I relish their taunts and sideways glances; I look forward to the dropped jaws. I am amazed with how they are allowed to interact with this world, questioning and pointing and laughing and interrogating the things that pass them by, not allowed to go unnoticed though surely to soon be forgotten when a new mood moves in.</p></div><footer class="article-footer"><a data-url="https://peterforberg.github.io/2020/01/20/On-Kids-in-Cars-and-Cars-and-Kids-in-Cul-de-sacs/" data-id="ck5mle3me0000vwtze0p00v52" class="article-share-link">share</a></footer></div></article><article id="post-On-Camelback-a-Sea-of-Salt" class="article article-type-post" itemscope itemprop="blogPost" data-scroll-reveal><div class="article-inner"><header class="article-header"><h2 itemprop="name"><a class="article-title" href="/2020/01/19/On-Camelback-a-Sea-of-Salt/">On Camelback, a Sea of Salt</a></h2></header><div class="article-meta"><a href="/2020/01/19/On-Camelback-a-Sea-of-Salt/" class="article-date"><time datetime="2020-01-19T22:13:17.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">2020-01-19</time></a></div><div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>Peter Forberg</em></p><p>The pink lake is poorly named. From far away, the highly reflective surface looks like any other lake, if not more silvery than most, casting clouds and the canopies of trees into its mirror. Up close, the water is a murky reddish brown, like a watered down mole sauce. But from the right angle, at the perfect time of day, the wind will cause little waves of light to reflect the midday’s overbearing sun, and standing at its shore, one can see a pink glow in the distance, shining like an ethereal sea of pepto bismol. The pink lake is aptly named.</p><p>The color is caused by algae. The lake is filled with salt. At a maximum depth of 3 meters, 1.5 of those meters are salt. While I disagree that it is impossible to drown in, it’s mostly for wading. Those who harvest the salt, men usually, cover themselves in shea butter to prevent the salt from damaging their skin. They wade out with their boats and scoop the salt into them until they reach a weight of about a tonne. Then they bring them to shore where they sell the salt to women. Women have first dibs on selling the salt to large companies that then ship it around the world. Huge mounds of salt lay in the sun to dry.</p><p><img

Tangled threads criss-cross over rolling sand dune and glance past rocky bluff, trapping small palm trees in the space between asphalt and fence, routing traffic down endless roads that disappear into the horizon where the sea meets the dust, and creating small mazes embedded within labyrinths where cornerstore boutiques duplicate themselves like a prison of mirrors that obscures your way home. At dusk, the city becomes a puzzle, the neon signs of pharmacies and wine shops flickering on, hot pinks and morning greens combatting the orange hue of a setting sun that will soon cast citizens deep into an unforgiving, starless night. Baobab trees, the untouchable symbol of the nation protected from axe and chainsaw, spring from parks, interrupt intersections, and grow into the sides of apartment buildings. Under the cover of their branches, city dwellers walk home from work, quick to bolt the doors behind themselves.</p><p>In this crowd of commuters, a tourist finds himself wandering the haphazard streets, pulled along by the swarm of those who know better than him Dakar’s aimless paths. But he is a sore thumb. From out of the sea emerges a figure who extends his hand and offers a common greeting, “Salam aleykoum.” <em>Peace be upon you.</em></p><p>On another street, at another time, on another path walked through the maze, a student is commiserating with the folks she meets, her eager desire to experience the city from the eyes of its inhabitants guiding her words, an endless stream of “How are you?” and “Nice to meet you.” He sees her, too. He extends his hand with an open palm and soon peace is upon her.</p><p>The tourist is being led down a series of sharp turns, propelled forward by the mystic’s words of warning, his insistence that the tourist must follow him, an unwavering belief that the two know each other and must help each other. Fed lie after lie, the tourist doesn’t know what to believe, and finds himself brought into boutiques and stores and storage centers, unsure of how he could initiate an exit should things go south. They’ve already gone south, and soon he finds himself in front of an ATM.</p><p>The student is clutching her necklace, a family heirloom, and pulling it off of her neck, gingerly placing it into the open palm of the man before her. “More,” he suggests, and her feet abide. The two are walking back to her home where she lives with a Senegalese family, and now they are ascending the staircase, passing by maid and mother wordlessly into the rooftop terrace where she’s hidden her treasures from home.</p><p>The tourist struggles to remember this part. <em>Why didn’t I leave? Why didn’t I catch him in his lies? Why would I agree to do this? How could I be so stupid?</em> Here’s the ATM, his card in hand, and here he is dispensing bills, more money than he’s willing to admit. Gone. Dispensed into the waiting palms of a family friend, perhaps a neighbor, or perhaps a demon in disguise.</p><p>Jewelry, money, technology–it’s all given over to the mystic. He asks and she complies. She unloads her valuables into his arms and he is pleased. When asked, she’ll describe the haze, the fogginess, the feeling that she wasn’t in control of her own body. She’ll try to give details, but the particulars escape her.</p><p>In both cases, the police will understand. The families will look on in horror. Their Senegalese contacts–employers, teachers, relatives–they’ll all ask the same question: <em>Before all of this happened, before he took everything away from you, did he shake your hand?</em> They’ll gasp. They’ll scream. They’ll bow their heads in sympathy. <em>The Mystic,</em> they’ll proclaim.</p><p>With an open palm, he’ll extend an invitation for him to rest in your brain. If you accept, he will take your body away from you. But he won’t stop there. Tourists, students, unsuspecting children–he preys on those too polite or naive to decline a greeting from a stranger. And then things will get stranger.</p><h2 id="A-Truth-That-Unites"><a href="#A-Truth-That-Unites" class="headerlink" title="A Truth That Unites"></a>A Truth That Unites</h2><p>During our first few days in Dakar, we were briefed on some stark cultural differences that may manifest in our interactions with the Senegalese people who we meet, and so were informed to be wary of offense. For example, greetings are a large part of Senegalese culture, so it’s rude to enter a home without formally greeting the people living there, even if you are counted among them. A few key mantras were roughly translated to us from Wolof, and I will do my best to recap them here:</p><blockquote><ul><li>You are not controlled by time; you control time.</li><li>It is better to be fearful than feared.</li><li>Love can be tough, sometimes physically. (To be fair, this was eloquently put in Wolof, something about a mother animal having to hit their child to demonstrate poor behavior.)</li><li>Without your fellow man, you are defenseless. You must accept your position then in a community of protectors.</li><li>The more a mother suffers, the more a child will succeed.</li><li>A lie that unites is better than a truth that divides.</li></ul></blockquote><p>The last mantra suggests the power of a relative truth, something which exceeds what we call “white lies.” These are powerful, lasting lies that can alter one’s knowledge of the world. Having run this phrase by my host sister, she agreed that it is best to be dishonest if it protects another person’s feelings. The man who told us of this mantra gave us the example of an affair: if his friend was cheating on his wife, he would not tell the wife; instead, he would tell his friend to stop cheating or be honest himself. Of course, while this rule of “ignorant bliss” is what the Senegalese consider best practice, it’s certainly not routinely applied. For an American example, see: <em>treat others the way you want to be treated.</em></p><p>Regardless, it’s how I want to approach the story of the mystic, which was recently invoked by one of our professors due to the experience of a student at our research center. Talking to this student, he immediately admitted that the events that unfolded were likely his own fault, and that he was just put in a difficult social situation that he wasn’t sure how to get out of. Similar to my experience at Sandaga Market, his status as a tourist, his desire to be kind, and his sense of adventure landed him in a place where there was no easy way out. However, after telling the story to the police, our handlers, and his family, they all immediately asked if he had shaken hands with the man. When he said yes, they relaxed. This wasn’t the case of a naive tourist, this was the case of a hypnotized victim manipulated by ancient magic.</p><p>Because I tend not to believe in the preternatural, it seems logical that the mystic became an easy way to explain one’s way out of a stupid mistake: drawing on the immensely religious Sufi spirit of Senegal, one could point to longheld myths about magical men and unexplained mysteries to recontextualize what were really just skillful muggings. It makes victims blameless, and it reaffirms any tourist’s conception of the strange, “other” continent as filled with magic and myth. An enterprising victim might play into this lie in order to look less stupid, and the police might play into this lie in order to make the victim feel less stupid. Either way, it is a fiction that makes the entire situation much more manageable. Rather than confronting head-on the troubles of Senegalese crime or the naivite of tourists, one can push human psychology into the realm of unexplainable magic.</p><h2 id="A-Way-to-Say-Hello"><a href="#A-Way-to-Say-Hello" class="headerlink" title="A Way to Say Hello"></a>A Way to Say Hello</h2><p>While standing in the living room talking to my host father and a few other various people, a young girl who I had never seen before walked up to me and extended a hand. I didn’t really notice her and continued talking until my host father looked at me seriously and said, “Shake.” Suddenly, the room went quiet as I shook her hand. Wordlessly, she walked to every person in the room, shook their hands, and then walked out. Everyone resumed talking. Papa turned to me and said, “You must shake.” Then he jumped back into conversation like nothing had happened.</p><p>When I told Nick the story of the mystic, it was late at night and we were going to the terrace. I left him to get his laundry from the clothesline, and when I came back he screamed. The mystic. I wonder how he slept that night.</p></div><footer class="article-footer"><a data-url="https://peterforberg.github.io/2020/01/18/The-Mystic/" data-id="ck5jydkjv0000vgtze062003d" class="article-share-link">share</a></footer></div></article></article><nav class="page-nav"><span class="page-number current">1</span><a class="page-number" href="/page/2/">2</a><a class="page-number" href="/page/3/">3</a><a class="extend next" rel="next" href="/page/2/">next page</a></nav></section></div><footer class="footer"><div class="outer"><ul class="list-inline"><li>&copy; 2020 Peter Forberg &amp; Nicholas Earley</li><li></li></ul><ul class="list-inline"><li></li><li></li></ul></div></footer><div class="to_top"><div class="totop" id="totop"><i class="ri-arrow-up-line"></i></div></div></main><aside class="sidebar"><button class="navbar-toggle"></button><nav class="navbar"><div class="logo"><a href="/"><img src="/images/ayer-side.svg" alt="Peter &amp; Nick"></a></div><ul class="nav nav-main"><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-item-link" href="/">Home</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-item-link" href="/archives">Archive</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-item-link" href="/about">About</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-item-link" href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></nav><nav class="navbar navbar-bottom"><ul class="nav"><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-item-link nav-item-search" title="Search"><i class="ri-search-line"></i> </a><a class="nav-item-link" target="_blank" href="/atom.xml" title="RSS Feed"><i class="ri-rss-line"></i></a></li></ul></nav><div class="search-form-wrap"><div class="local-search local-search-plugin"><input type="search" id="local-search-input" class="local-search-input" placeholder="Search..."><div id="local-search-result" class="local-search-result"></div></div></div></aside><div id="mask"></div><div id="reward"><span class="close"><i class="ri-close-line"></i></span><p class="reward-p"><i class="ri-cup-line"></i>请我喝杯咖啡吧~</p><div class="reward-box"><div class="reward-item"><img class="reward-img" src="/images/alipay.jpg"> <span class="reward-type">支付宝</span></div><div class="reward-item"><img class="reward-img" src="/images/wechat.jpg"> <span class="reward-type">微信</span></div></div></div><script src="/js/jquery-2.0.3.min.js"></script><script src="/js/jquery.justifiedGallery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/lazyload.min.js"></script><script src="/js/busuanzi-2.3.pure.min.js"></script><script src="/fancybox/jquery.fancybox.min.js"></script><script>var ayerConfig={mathjax:!1}</script><script src="/js/ayer.js"></script><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery-modal@0.9.2/jquery.modal.min.js"></script><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery-modal@0.9.2/jquery.modal.min.css"><script type="text/javascript" src="https://js.users.51.la/20544303.js"></script></div></body>
