We have not agreed to this. I thank my lucky stars for the bat that appeared at 10:30 PM last week and at first seemed to me to be a sloppy hawk. No, it was a perfect bat, with wings as long tennis rackets and a dropping flight pattern that made it primed for the hunt. It competes with the owl for the place in my heart.</p><p>2 weeks ago Nick was sick and I joked in French<sup>1</sup> at the dinner bowl that Americans who get sick in Senegal think that they will soon die. I do not fear death,<sup>2</sup> but now I wake up in a sweat and untangle myself from the mosquito net. Papa and sister are looming over me, having decided that there is no need for overhead lighting.</p><p>“Do you need to go to the hospital?” he says, her “How are you feeling?” apparently not clear enough. I explain I’m fine, just a little case of food poisoning. “What have you eaten?” Pretzels, oranges, Powerade– “Yesterday?” Bread, peanut butter, a hamburger, chicken with pasta. “Do you need to go to the hospital?” I think it was the hamburger. Nods of agreement. “Do you have medication?” I’m fine, again, really, and they wish me good night.</p><p>Buy chewable pepto bismol and always take your probiotics, also chewable. Preferably flavored. Treat your body like a baby while abroad in a country where the food has a grudge. You are a baby, and cuisine is killer.</p><p>If you ever find yourself in Dakar after classes get out at Cheikh Anta Diop University in the Fann Quartier, do yourself a favor an avoid the “double humburger [sic]” priced at 2000 CFA but charged at 1500 CFA from stall #13 in the outdoor cafeteria. I promise you, you’re not missing much.</p><p>Tomorrow the host niece remembers my comment and says, “Now you think you will die.” No, I say, I only have one body and I want to be nice to it. This is the same reason I give to my professor when I miss two days of class. Americans need to work less.</p><p>Down the street is a restaurant called Wonderfood. It sells hamburgers that I will never buy. You tell me if the logo looks familiar.</p><p><img src="https://africa-public.food.jumia.com/assets/production/sn/images/vendors/s6rb.jpg?v=20180309193606" alt="wonderfood"></p><p>For educational purposes: in Senegal, people eat around a large (usually metallic) bowl. Some people sit on stools or couches, mostly older folk, but most just find ways to take up less space than usual. The right hand holds the spoon or fork or torn off piece of baguette used to grab the food inside, which is almost always rice with some onion-garnished protein. The left hand does not touch the bowl or the mouth for that is the hand used to clean oneself.</p><p>I do not think this post is valueless, but it was written when I was empty. I was living for three days on mandarins and pretzels and Powerade. The smell of fish sent me spinning. We have fish for 2 meals a day. I will keep the post as is, for posterity.</p><p><sup>1</sup> I will often talk about Nick in French as if he is not there to my host family, usually my host sister. This is never to insult him. I only ever speak the truth. In fact, I frequently insist that he is more intelligent than me and has better luck with women, which is apparently important to our hosts. Still, he has received the nickname “Karma Boy” for his unlucky streaks, while I have received the nickname “Lucifer” for being a “many face devil.”</p><p><sup>2</sup> I do fear death.</p></div><footer class="article-footer"><a data-url="https://peterforberg.github.io/2020/02/03/My-Body-and-I-Are-Not-on-Speaking-Terms/" data-id="ck66taydt0000f0tzegeqa3mh" class="article-share-link">share</a></footer></div></article><article id="post-Chocopain" class="article article-type-post" itemscope itemprop="blogPost" data-scroll-reveal><div class="article-inner"><header class="article-header"><h2 itemprop="name"><a class="article-title" href="/2020/02/02/Chocopain/">Chocopain</a></h2></header><div class="article-meta"><a href="/2020/02/02/Chocopain/" class="article-date"><time datetime="2020-02-02T17:32:01.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">2020-02-02</time></a></div><div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>Peter Forberg</em></p><p>Chocopain is the newest superfruit. It is the fluoride in your faucet. It is the opium of the masses, water drawn from the fountain of youth, blood siphoned from innocents, the fruit of temptation, the latest fad diet. Chocopain got the entire Senegalese Olympic team disqualified <em>and</em> gold medals. Chocopain was put on the streets by the FBI because they knew it was irresistible. Dick Cheney made money off of it. It sharpens your senses, it heightens your hormones, it makes the arid lands of the Sahel fertile and lush. To bathe in it is to have perfect skin, to smell it is to clear your senses, to know her is to love her.</p><p>Every day at noon, I walk the 20 feet from the research center to the closest boutique and ask the guy, my guy, for a piece of bread with chocopain. Graciously, he takes half of a baguette and slices it lengthwise, then from behind the counter pulls a gallon-sized tub of deep chocolate-peanut butter spread into view, spooning onto the bread one, two, three, four, five, maybe even six endless streams of nature’s nectar. He wraps the bread in old German newspaper, perhaps some extra printer paper from someone’s economics homework, and hands it over to me like a midwife. I pay my guy 250 CFA (42 cents), walk down to La Corniche, and throw myself into the ocean.</p><p>Conspiracy theorists love the mass-marketed brainwash serum, the Coca-Cola that is secretly getting you to vote blue, the newest medication that has the little known side effect of radicalizing youth. In Dakar, billboards are plastered with images of chocopain, the Nutella-like breakfast spread that is a staple in all Senegalese homes. Chocolat by Delia makes a strong showing, similar in flavor profile if a bit underwhelming, while some other cheap brand with a lion as a mascot leans too heavily into the peanut and ruins the texture. Nutella is fine, but it is hazelnut, an invasive take on the spread. Senegal’s trade was built on their peanut farming, so the homeland needs to capitalize on the ingredients held most precious. A taste of Senegal is a taste of chocopain, which has become less of a brand name and more like a way of living. The French can keep their pain au chocolat, this expat needs a reversal of roles: chocolate with bread.</p><p>In homes, empty chocopain tubs of various sizes take on a new life. With their little white handles and easy open lids, the smallest ones can become cute containers for keepsakes, while the slightly larger and deeper size has been known to hold juice for my maman. Outside of my window, the largest size is scattered across the rooftops of a recently refurbished apartment building. Previously, they held paint and tools for the construction workers, and orange liquid glooped about the rim, sending my senses spinning: what was this new liquid sloshing about the familiar tub?</p><p>Some liquids have a maximum volume for sensibility. Take a moment to close your eyes and picture the largest volume of milk you can allow. For me, it’s a kitty pool. Orange juice should never occupy anything larger than a bathtub. Most other juices, at least without pulp, could probably go Olympic, but they cap out at a lake. Hell, Olympic might be pushing it, especially for cranberry. Still, chocopain deserves the oceans.</p></div><footer class="article-footer"><a data-url="https://peterforberg.github.io/2020/02/02/Chocopain/" data-id="ck65b15jn0000ictz59blhicn" class="article-share-link">share</a></footer></div></article><article id="post-The-Road-to-Toubakouta" class="article article-type-post" itemscope itemprop="blogPost" data-scroll-reveal><div class="article-inner"><header class="article-header"><h2 itemprop="name"><a class="article-title" href="/2020/02/02/The-Road-to-Toubakouta/">The Road to Toubakouta</a></h2></header><div class="article-meta"><a href="/2020/02/02/The-Road-to-Toubakouta/" class="article-date"><time datetime="2020-02-02T12:17:32.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">2020-02-02</time></a></div><div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>Peter Forberg</em></p><p>Last weekend, we were given 3 days off to explore Senegal. A friend and I decided that we wanted to head south to a national park on the Saloum Delta. We would stay in the small town of Toubakouta, where our program advisors could recommend a guide and hotel. This is the story of that trip. This will be long.</p><p>Also, hey! I’ve been sick. More posts soon. Including a post about being sick.</p><h3 id="Ma-Petite-Chef"><a href="#Ma-Petite-Chef" class="headerlink" title="Ma Petite Chef"></a>Ma Petite Chef</h3><p>Behind every great road trip planner, there is a small sardonic Vietnamese woman with a knack for bargaining and an encyclopedic knowledge of Trip Advisor. Because this blog is necessarily to be kept secret from anyone on this study abroad program, we’ll call her MPC: <em>ma petite chef.</em> Together, we set out to organize a small, logistically simple trip to the Sine-Saloum region. Our closest friends, like Nick, the absentee father of this blog, were immediately invited, while others were left to fend for themselves unless we suddenly were able to accommodate even more people. We weren’t, but we did.</p><p>A fun fact about study abroad programs hosted at a small research center in which a group of complete strangers have limited social options for 9 weeks: everyone wants to fit in lest they die of social isolation. Unlike in larger social settings where people can retreat to familiar groups of friends, search for new social outlets, or spend extended periods of time fading in and out of social interaction, the city of Dakar locks you into a rigid social circle where acceptance is a must. You don’t have the luxury of 4 years to get to know these people, abandon them, or find other folks. You have 9 weeks together, and you want to get the most out of it.</p><p>That’s how MPC and I ended up in charge of 12 other people. Once word spread of our weekend getaway, the sudden accusations of being exclusionary forced us to expand our troop to include over half of the program. The plan was as follows: leave Dakar on a Dem Dikk at 7 AM on Friday, arrive in the city of Kaolack, get picked up by our guide and driven to Toubakouta, spend the next two days in Toubakouta, reverse the directions to get home. After hours of messaging AirBnBs, combing through Booking.com, and translating our plans to our advisor who then translated them to the phone-operated bus station, we were ready to leave. Hours of driving, boating, and hiking awaited us.</p><h3 id="Kaolack-or-Bust"><a href="#Kaolack-or-Bust" class="headerlink" title="Kaolack or Bust"></a>Kaolack or Bust</h3><p>At 6:30 AM, our small battalion marched from a local bakery to the Dem Dikk station, the morning sun still slumbering beneath the horizon. Unlike the Megabus stops sporadically distributed on city streets in the US, this bus station was comprised of one big sandy lot pulled together by fences where Nescafe carts and taxi drivers waited to greet weary travelers beginning or finishing their national excursions, rows of gently idling buses lined up next to one another with little to no order. Once aboard, most passengers were overtaken by sleep, but for those who stayed awake, the urban terrain of Dakar gave way to new landscapes with the rising light. The red dust disappeared and was now replaced by wide, endless savannahs, tall prairie grass peppered with the occasional low, shady tree. Baobabs cropped up more frequently, eventually creating small forests of those grey, solemn trunks and leafless canopies.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2OAJlTKPklhE1fSF4aj6rCK1HCDOV9Kq4lgb-EoOUDUHXw7UrAG5eaOoyMKE0V84C5_N_W_ZILTKc2XPqWeiTJq8IurnFWNo7Vm9K0ISQmfoF2LGFyzwcyhpZKXfhmnsBQyRwyYag2agOgIt0IwibFkJgmSCII99EYJEMjndZs_2lxt_IxHHEFyX-eyyBYpJajsG31EI3HoXmVdbfjmNVg4iz8lafFG5QeKftzP_30mG6vXjeUEY4325QJGsYRASTR8-ishB5IUobtWKjmiNph2ir84xhMsP4i8vz8muM3j8oHbwiLHxk8OvUtDqNyQr8WSCVMT4JHum96Fhw-DSMDGZc1gIipChXvVzIAIz_2hLI21dCZ3dfYfy8Rz73iy_4KJuzAeDLLdfxvRVyK21SmimX5GfrqFkVmBOkddb2UtW0M2XLHxscpAWugyAXjsHXEYqkjNzcuDW-FxA-zbU4W3cNS0wr2RSyK91MzZOzq_6IfI5AEUWdXA2LYE7SHDcIKu49QvRW-4rr8PKShpyg5Ab9eH8PF8z9LAaiULoaMbnJGEDxImNJp-sVha6XKHHs3OYxt0W_VjccoYkbw4dpDjO6Bb4ra_fwcVRZu9zmkJG4jVTMKEhw9SjrLJoe0D4-idRM3SsIcNuo8LUbYf3AJLhoKajYxanMD8Y5of6JQB6jzf4q-d4MKWTrsJFF7Illk3NuTamJ7TyXcwRpgP5ppexHitvvCVMvav-s2DBRfYvFLmT=w1157-h867-no" alt="some bad trees" title="some bad nature photography from inside of a bus"></p><p>As we approached Kaolack, this vegetation died off, leaving in its place sand pits and small, dried up riverbeds. Ponds maintained themselves with only a few inches of water, and the histories of rain and currents and ebbs and flows were etched into the Earth’s surface. Towns appeared at the edge of the road, mostly compounds consisting of thin thatched huts surrounded by jump-able concrete walls. There were some homes more reminiscent of the colonial architecture, but the majority were just round, one room structures made of straw and mud and wood. Clotheslines connected them, and people sat outside in the winter heat, tending goats and carrying bushels of tinder on their heads. Drifting smoke clouds rose from burned trash heaps, and the air felt dry and empty.</p><p>When we passed through larger towns, they seemed similar enough to Dakar. Though an absolute fraction of the capitol city’s size, the economy of cornerstore boutiques and market stalls were present on the sidewalks; however, the full scope of life was noticeably limited. People lived on subsistence, without cars or taxis or cellphones or WIFI. While there may be concrete homes or pharmacies, these spaces were devoid of the modern luxuries that filled Dakarois apartments. Windows were no more than empty concrete holes, streets unanimously made of sand, mattresses perpetually without bedframes, and even the freshest of fruit not aesthetically appealing enough for imperfect produce. People pulled water from crumbling wells affixed with wooden pulleys protected by legions of flies, while pigs romped beneath horse-drawn carriages.</p><p>The city of Kaolack is merely a bigger version of these countryside towns, equipped with modernity’s ATMs, hotels, and cellphones. Pigs now ran through the wheels of semi-trucks, none of which seemed operational with their hoods overturned, and windows became adorned with curtains or even glass. Brutally reminded of our outsider status, we were swarmed by taxi drivers offering to deliver us wherever we needed to go, and it was at this moment that I called our guide.</p><p>Malang was given to us by our host institution, recommended as a good friend who could easily show us around. However, we weren’t aware of the fact that he isn’t actually a tour guide. He is a university student who lives in Toubakouta when he can’t afford to pursue his degree. He also speaks very little English. After many brief, poorly translated phone calls, he told us to wait by a main road where a 14-seater would appear in order to pick us up. The only catch to this agreement was that the driver spoke no French. In the South of Senegal, Wolof is our only friend. Luckily, we’re not a difficult group to pick out, even in a crowd, so we waited under a water tower where local kids questioned us until a charming short white bus with fold-down seats rolled up, confirming that we were the right people when I yelled his Senegalese name and he yelled “Toubakouta!” As we squeezed into place, we found ourselves on the road to our final destination.</p><h3 id="To-Be-Stuck-Outside-a-Mobile"><a href="#To-Be-Stuck-Outside-a-Mobile" class="headerlink" title="To Be Stuck Outside a Mobile"></a>To Be Stuck Outside a Mobile</h3><p>We were 30 minutes into our hour long trek when the driver pulled over to the side of the road. Here, a man with a notebook marked down the number of people in the car, though there was truly no discernible reason why he should have that authority. A few meters from the bus, a slant tin hut slouched beneath a tree, the only source of shade for horizons. There were saleswomen and whittlers, people on phones just relaxing at this vacant patch of plastic-filled desert miles from any homes or towns in the heat as if this was a fun place to be. The longer the bus sat, the more the onlookers met our eyes.</p><p>Now women approached the bus, platters of peanuts and water bags on their heads. Now our driver conversed with the notebook man, pointing at each of us. Now we politely dismissed the saleswomen. Now the driver turned the key. Now something was wrong.</p><p>For a few fortuitous minutes, we assumed that perhaps this was some sort of routine, a common side effect of long drives out in 100 degree weather with old buses. Surely the driver, like all Senegalese workers, had an intimate relationship with his vehicle and would soon remember its oft-forgotten quirk of not starting the engine. But more soon we were piling out of the bus, and he was lifting up the driver’s seat which hid the engine beneath. Having no way to communicate, we stood idly at the side of the road waiting. MPC and I decided to hike a little way back to a baobab tree to take pictures, thinking the detour would waste enough time before the driver fixed the problem.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2UPGuTn5N3lzZQvDTzyNqhNbapzBV-iaSRU8U7G74ek1nikQZCydzitqFisqUlVOVTLAusYy6GkCU6Hn3Hk0D7GiIVQPOUrRppPp0RsSUmr9pS03_3uo6QIYRc1o0mXeq1pQTlaB1hEpoGaFrv0wv946o2HCjSSejlNlun58WE90hpB_MjDq7ZhxKScwtZS02KeEJXjVnZpDmvmlCxu1ASOsrAkk8sQQTirNat6S_ElkWdiaBCP13DzBkZ6YmDQdrTdEUce6na5xjhUQRZ6TbScv8BRndk17LxOI41VY-O8VknYJXQmdbFrmcpaUbGGQ6fjkW7sE5iPJSm2Od8gdBg-BSiuC-CWnCF_DAxb3z2g2m3GWR0HWW9lLnjJtKzN9WqYEbi5uFMpRfbPTwt-4e9jM4Wd8TAea3Q--SZNbaWZ85NjVPU3Ru1YJ3pKpQ0cHZFIMervv5xL0kS3WFunxJG2sH1bAOB-v25POTyRjhRlkopMSDXJNopXeD65AjeMvUKF07pQCfZMIzt0W-OV8GdhxsfmjMHQ_eybRfBpeeHeZ0hCN6oFxgSTHbZx4W8N0Mu98jiwFtRRxTxksgkBmuNPLi807Y76nkXPEn5AdeNLPGtJzuw9-1NUeKg2fxP16kIEkDvqMp3APRtWWKjhyn1Ate22HjEkGpoIIFQgqFPbF5-kXSp593gerM1U2hGNhYBQoK4eCzZlB-NAJ-F35zQXmTs_rUhrWyrsMr2DMk_4txYm5=w651-h867-no" alt="me on a tree" title="me on a tree"></p><p>We were wrong. When we returned, our friends had all slumped against the shady side of the shack, hidden from the sun. At this makeshift checkpoint, an increasingly delirious group of stranded Americans replayed their favorite middle school games, clapping to elementary beats riddled by memory, digging our heels into the quickly disappearing sand to prepare for offensive attacks, and reciting familiar rhymes somehow dispersed across the entirety of the US. We peeled carrots to be dipped in cooking peanut oil—another mistranslation—and took photos with the locals, who, again, spoke no French and were not gifted with photography. Using my knowledge of interrogative grammar in Wolof and a printed list of verbs provided by our professor, I asked our driver if he could fix the problem. Multiple phone calls and reassurances later, and we had travelled into the brush of prairie grass. One girl sat cross-legged on the roadside, catcalled by a troop of teenage boys who materialized from the literal desert, apparently able to sense and locate the most inappropriate time to display their fledgling toxic masculinity, while another group commiserated beneath what was either a very large bush or a very small tree, talking excitedly as a herd of goats marched through our makeshift encampment.</p><p>In the midst of this midday delirium, we were suddenly all called over to the bus, rushing out of bushes and grass and dust, and we eagerly repacked our bags and bid farewell to our temporary hosts. It was then we realized that the engine was still fully exposed.</p><p>We would not be taking the bus to Toubakouta.</p><p>Of course, no one could explain this to us. Instead, we would pile into a car rapide, which our driver had given the name of our hotel, and ride with rural Senegal’s daily commuters until we arrived at our destination. The cost, distance, and duration were unimportant. What was important was that I was seated on a sack of onions, someone else’s fanny pack in my hands, with a toddler sucking his thumb and wrapping his other arm around my shin, staring at me like the alien I truly am.</p><p>I’m writing a post about transit, but a brief overview of car rapides: brightly painted husks of half-buses, these public transport stand-ins are outfitted with rows of seats or benches facing either the windshield or the doors. In this case, our car rapide was a mixture of all those things. Women, children, and tourists are given priority seating, with some people standing inside, but when it gets to overcrowding, the men will stand on the bumper in the rear, hanging onto the double van doors. The driver is assisted by a man in the back who pounds on the ceiling when someone needs to get off. In Dakar, they take many forms and many routes, but it was evident that in rural Senegal these vans were being used in place of public buses, thus many passengers were women returning from the bigger towns loaded up with vegetables and bread. Packed like sardines, we held children in our laps, squeezed three to a seat, and forced some regulars to wait for another bus to come, much to their ire. And as we neared our destination, unsure of how to finalize things, a motorcycle pulled into view, first trailing us from behind, then dragging up alongside us, until it eventually led in front, commanding the bus to stop. Our guide had arrived, and so had we.</p><h3 id="La-Kora-Le-Chef"><a href="#La-Kora-Le-Chef" class="headerlink" title="La Kora: Le Chef"></a>La Kora: Le Chef</h3><p>Our hotel consisted of a series of cabins enclosed by a sky-blue plastered concrete wall. Named after a popular Senegalese instrument, its rustic appeal certainly made clear that it was intended for those visiting on a budget, which is to say: it was a very nice place; it just wasn’t the seaside treehouse accommodations provided to wealthy European tourists whose hotel staff would collect sand from the shore to fill handmade glass candles in celebration of foreigners’ birthdays. The staff was warm and kind throughout our stay, frequently asking us questions and giving advice about where to go. The boss, Am, quickly latched onto MPC and me as the leaders of the group, which is where she gets her nickname: “This is my little boss,” I would say, “She has the brains, I just speak French poorly.” A fair assessment.</p><p>Later, Am would notice us all milling about a baobab pod curiously and offer to open it. A man of ducked doorframes and second-helpings, we would watch his towering frame thrust the pod into the hard cement, sending it sun-bound until it crashed back at his feet, where he would take a rock and pound its woody shell over and over and over and over again until pith and seed unwound from their tight casing and erupted into the air. Holding the mangled form in his two grizzly hands, he would present it to MPC and say, simply, “It’s not ripe.”</p><p>I’m running out of prose.</p><p>Given lodging, student prices, and perfectly inoffensive Senegalese meals, we cherished our accommodating hotel staff. More than that, we were grateful. Grateful that they didn’t complain when we bought cheaper water from the village, grateful that they gave us knives and spoons to host our island picnic, and grateful that, after a little wine, they didn’t condemn our singing of early 2000s pop hits, instead remarking in the way that only grown men raised in a strictly Muslim country who had thus never drank let alone to excess could, “You all look possessed.”</p><p>We slept on thin mattresses and ate fresh jam. La Kora was good to us.</p><h3 id="A-Hard-Headed-Boy"><a href="#A-Hard-Headed-Boy" class="headerlink" title="A Hard-Headed Boy"></a>A Hard-Headed Boy</h3><p>If this is supposed to be an educational blog, I guess now is the time. The morning after our day of travel, we readied ourselves for a trip to the mangroves: low, water-rich trees with roots that criss-cross over one another, veins exposed when the tide is low. The beach of mud held our pirogue, which is a traditional form of boat used widely in Senegal but familiar to much of Africa and Latin America. In our bags, MPC and I held 10 baguettes, chocopain (a nutella-like ambrosia), and bissap-banana jam. Bissap is a Hibiscus flower commonly used to make delicious, sugary drinks in West Africa. In this case, it was used to make delicious, sugary banana jam.</p><p>Our captain, who spoke little and little French, marched us through the mud into his ornately colored vessel, and we were soon lost in a maze of wide, shimmering rivers leading out to the open ocean. The Saloum Delta is not known for overwhelmingly confusing geography, but at 100F and language-starved, our sudden ascendance into a vast network of islands mostly inhabited by monkeys, birds, and hyenas made the low hanging clouds that shrouded the mangroves all that more haunting. One could imagine the boat crashing into a log hidden by the midday sun’s staunch reflection and being catapulted into the bramble of roots, climbing from branch to branch as the tide rose, keeping bare feet away from the sharp oysters that line the river bed.</p><p>But we were fine, and the mangroves were beautiful.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZwOz51zlV3KLU6ittFA9tp4925_zBtlV2EF0P5SQgDjfl1v73cT4BUZZzIBofNmuCnwqJZWWFvgLc3NO7CZHbonwcOKmpM0MXBLu9l75yA4JFA5TyVWu2YRQ76xnD5O28a_m1nNcHMSmdxxk22NQMbXdOX_uplNsh7vgQyg0Hk3XYwCIJ-qovTPo7SN21ww4CykX1zzSz2bSnRNcWjOL93wN7AcR5AQu8zSbjNS5EAD40YsiKS5biXu0ojjm57HtLBS3ZzIqaadHTjLGxfJptvPLKAMtooMVMFlfgR9ChfE7d8BeIz-WyKv1Bjzz252XsPUvQn-vFSFwOQcDFIp5r_pCoOAdw2gWiltdE3dLcgR9I2QMQVAAXSLDXHQLHlgvaXy-Z6BI3F0-UnNVIfo2o8uwAaxXP0Orx7MJnrpaCpEguSG2KE5lYfHEl808BZDpq3o4wdq56qYn7P14a2nByd5nDSOmNl3AaP_qIvZ0bYzOoX0HskEsXPusVLriBJlKb1LRnV9kOKBttWgig-kZhuwHaqSYgRFyp1ABMyXImvlSbDO4X_X8Q5UDDEYB6DDgUeW4k56ALyh0ottl5GBc5p3Moh-exU-mMmuXHlzEA_uqB5wXY2F74-JYvkrts3itzIPPw1pb7-HLB5cMzjXgTxWESmUrwxf5rw94YArLqn-pOZffA7w50HPOxXFuk874tb3pjdJDRgORk8lhimEeMXZ_5CdBU8BJD4JOR9URQh4QCWR3=w1157-h867-no" alt="mangroves"></p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/U_PvdWfvJMACvn326wZyWH7yv33x_bFT_rDu3h7iL6cFYI_LACWPIhnre8yaqzym7Ar26g4Dtkfjb73oPkNht4zltLZ8ubkC7UwFYUGKQEZlsNVB8BI4B8JSiIuJ67N6HreDGUFcbkGWy_bcijzh7QZWUkd4PfBOreo0VThfasyDfXsv2drapgWwoX8BJe9EO6xlq23NWvI2SVsqbgvAtSZy-_IL5som90shqQXA4VplR3BrTto08HmE6EPf3rQkVOLkYTIXv2cuWotg3-LXSuTdDBemOlBYo7re9XHRfUqJXL2fX4hEHvI_IU_wM0hvNpg1t97gm0Ngb66z1iEhBtig_G9fHmARpQGu64jeGBJ-6mJ3GC-mfh26jvWMhTucW8d6whh0whzEtPinhJJZ43wC15BIIK9bA7wm1NGQNYhQRkkW_X7e1K8wTFnUVM_2Wa9o7YV0lOD9zNiSQ3eksWMJxwlmXcNPX4jv8xD843IHJ2pHgEurTYWw9s1dJQwGd9jOm6U2DL5UlnhK9Ad1zCO2YoxlJE8tGjSUlRQ6wUHZM41kCN3s4oOif4Wz69KvnjlIERDnqHBBXodBH0Tz5Ff_xyicRTpAWNwQlzK5oh5ylF1ts5m1zLvarA-ajDZXT9aiD-BVkNu9MwZEUA4C5N6d_1_Nti9DNtTKFQL_S6ozSfDlERRfm33g6I6sK0A2Cfj0oCbkmfRXrfFMFhHy_RUBB49zLg9eBGi7XM1dxGkdMV-H=w1157-h867-no" alt="more mangroves" title="more mangroves"></p><p>We first stopped at a larger fishing island where villagers harvested oysters and then piled up their shells, drying them in the sun in order to later turn them into white paint, making art to sell to tourists.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UKIVU0cLKjU0mdbiQOyOC8AQwHHDVqDdO0oOx9IKC9NjgJ8Z0dxxLdQ101GOqlkYq1Pya6LmQyAuaTFvax6zq5t9wJJZhkbdfZOXJ-QWKn2I_rVM4DfHebKwDJkKtUUvAQ_puYi_g56wAM__Ammu8OyvQyP1hfB7-hhQyxU9uzNFMJ2-eZGlgsS1FyR_nmwo1g1Q2-oU06aYme2SzWbTRjUCTz-uUw1vmX-5WUK_yAubRIwjtyxhIHpAXVfWDo5jZlgNz7s35D6SCHaSHzkUog6fH9Zad0tLkHRUr1U5AOgS0o8q86grnadW_9GgcP0QBrUhyesb-jVn3-Ckq-_VkJcplN7it-XyosFEDuyDBgJ2jEVxBgpINVanFRJ8a0JVMMn8geUyfA1CxYKMFK_Vc1-OQyChaDdcDYaB_9rYKQaGJ1tKlbu-jp-6viO84_0mK65eIFjvGYDz28mqTS30Zl27-2kge6ibZnAfkUtD2q4vwDSL3axjTg6mPl0axRBXpfRPd8uNkmYT0UUgB3U6gCHuHsLE8uvStdWD8mwQrfjikpFnApEabkPWH-Fu_OPq6_cRU82ZnkO0I8TiA31U5cv9WlagbmJl1HyIRry7DTruA2P_RHD8MzlWWHJDNZLhMG7uXdiB0ic7Iew2aWBc6aCiCxkKYUmowXhKnZ5l2ta9ALWHf7nDq60BiIGDPobWnsDyAwIj0obtjtyH6gogVxje3D3P97z_Q5Iv60bg94et9xEP=w1157-h867-no" alt="seashells" title="senegalese sell seashells by the seashore"></p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FKpsuxuD1MJWxyBMwk5253Ni0gLvSU2KMOp9amuWfq9gFgBhBJjm95Ok_5zSbF9xap6flCAQpKmJZJqSEu_8OH2J_X_A9M3DCMf3qCcLMngkw8mQ_CqNNMj-kYQMg6wmtlt0khZNYODzFNBjNC6TrWxBLiI9-PeVxekoVOtwy_IFqiWNmG5r6wGZ7er3fNl1q2bWaxDLhAmY1LfZ3jFEF828KWTilpP8Usw1TAFLsn-jRok2GWAF0VSo1avdZQcY9z-dieQx48ypyy67vzvWuSDNJgiIE6U53hxOGq8J5ucKkXjMRmrxe0sGbbIDq-PBwHauO5YjFTGRLXgK9HZlw9vG3K1-oR6cw0sE6Iz3EQW1XPH0vzn5miHMfB0tJK6YBoKG3auY8ym-FEMDuX5iYNXthNcaQIU69F8Np5ndrsajkBWJJyW3fBocTsK8wO6gJV9RbHBH5j-zSLnwIry_c9njsTUTt98TZEn13ctzC9HrqMwU9dsFu5vw-_p07G5KSPmpBVlrSjUgz2OZ-KGlrpjhzLlLrnG93IatgSKqGo616XGKz-DLguC2DnplcCa9h_LMl_UVbMqRAcgI0uxVRRfs2bqrtdL8WJTVzCCp8LkmXEDDZ_Kf6lf9BwGIpiPm5Kj4n7ibO9ltL3MUcthTMYbwpJ_vtWK5vbDpo6J8Iu3MyXh-rZTD4PzhOESqpNko_7Fk_1VFWXU9RfqKRr4iwnCaRj-bSb7pAVTWl0QOy70EvawR=w1157-h867-no" alt="oh well" title="oh well"></p><p>The island also had a queen, an apparently 104 year-old woman of great wisdom who every visitor must greet. Every visitor, that is, who is coming from the treehouse-birthday candle-beachside resort.

We chatted about the island until it was time to pamper the guests, and then we hiked back to a picnic spot for that wonderful bissap-banana jam. These are the perks of knowing people instead of paper.</p><p>Another perk is that your boat captain is willing to lead you into the shallow waters of the mangroves where the canopy begins to puncture the sun. More than that, he’ll pull the boat into a tight, claustrophobic network of jailcell branches and shut off the engine, allowing the islands to speak for themselves. When you ask if people walk on the mangroves, he’ll say, “You can,” and then you’ll climb over the side of the boat and enter into the world’s most at-risk-of-disappearing-due-to-climate-change jungle gym. In broken English, as you jump from root to root, surprised by everyone else’s lack of balance, your guide will call you a “hard-headed boy,” and while you’re not sure what to make of that, you’ll take it as a compliment.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/N9fkpWRg7IWZM_UiHu0J9HjqBhc5CX1naUuE1xgWoSkqg32l8VczuYX7RNzNbtrpVLtpYRnmJ_siykVAo68uWKnjDHbLu9VPsOK2poH4SQq5lwkfBzTTQJugQq4aMK9JUXcLzUVvUMh5CN4SFeeeYehbSXZLucie3zjYEwNbJNyUKCfKFH-jbOYhiH-h-RI_eVCsBCIiI0AMrDh-Qom4rTmgGAuPJlvT467fNkyUE8cI2Jx7rM-1-HPoCoGVi8JXpndhQeBx4p9oK9T7jNtENC8MSR0nh7swfBEhJZTwtYqdIzAhhJaCTebuO23YnFSjyCxIvbdaaOdSZjyIRTd1XSs5oqoWmvxPgq7uT9MkAefVCbJ72YBuJudaXU3f1cDFxMV1LXypRBq0ERJemLbTnmfi78ONVuCtc0oc87EzghHEDctLQ1gJ4kzBTwDvQeXI0PnxjKRJe8cey3ozghCuE9w3V8nY2tfygttvhU2LqUWmpHCvAoKRrQPW_Gzi-HqjT7N-Yy6edr1sFidq3rqvsSSB3WV6CgWCklgPXsgHCuEBURqcE9QTtjbr6md_Dc5MHweCOd12-N4MsWvCAlOzviyrN4yv_ZTrZ66okeEwB6WrV7G2O5CM6xJgjxxL4yumEO_585ZdA-tMo_V5A1GJom4-lVaZ7OrlkSo8X210UElz1gOgeewaQ1jy_VQq1CiNCIToF0KVe0MRf906F-bDR6I5R2aEEpV5Ifm08YYzT4tXsv64=w651-h867-no" alt="we&#39;re on a boat"></p><p>At another island, this time made of seashells, we disembarked and were led down a shell path through a thick forest of baobabs and brush. Mounds of dirt marked the tombs of kings, supposedly buried with riches now protected by dark spirits (and UNESCO). A sacred baobab split down the middle made for the perfect hiding spot, and MPC collected her fateful baobab pods. There’s nothing else to say about this island other than that it was perfect and heaven.</p><h3 id="Papaya-Jam-Just-Tastes-Like-Baby-Food"><a href="#Papaya-Jam-Just-Tastes-Like-Baby-Food" class="headerlink" title="Papaya Jam Just Tastes Like Baby Food"></a>Papaya Jam Just Tastes Like Baby Food</h3><p>On our way back we saw a big beautiful bird, a seafoam heron who ignited his wings on our approach, and a monkey who played in the mud. I took no pictures and have few words.</p><p>After a break, we went to Toubakouta’s annual festival, a celebration of Senegal and Gambia’s friendship that invites local villages to come perform, sell, and eat together. For those who don’t know, Gambia is a funky country tucked inside of Senegal, a result of competing colonial powers. It exists along the highly resourceful Gambia River, and it divides the southernmost part of Senegal into two regions: Sine-Saloum (where we were) and Casamance (where the State Department will not allow us to go).</p><p>The merchants had a wide array of products ranging from street standard (like peanuts and dresses) to local grown (like bissap jam and special dissolving green tea). I was torn between a grapefruit and papaya jam, but a friend went with papaya so I made no choice. See heading.</p><p>In Toubakouta, while everyone speaks Wolof (the language), not everyone is Wolof (the ethnic group). A large number of people are Serer and thus speak Serer. So for a while we listened to a Serer band jam out in Serer, a crowd of people politely leaving space for passersby in the street, until a wall of activity blocked off the road behind us. Malang stood his ground and commanded me to tell everyone to stay put. Dust was being kicked up into the air. As the song wrapped up, the people on stage began glancing backwards to where the commotion was taking place, eventually giving up and turning around to watch in stunned silence. Officers and soldiers pushed us to the sides of buildings and entered the fray.</p><p>There was no shouting, only footfall. A ring of people defined the circle’s interior, mostly young men, and, with hands on knees in athletic poses, hollering from time to time, falling and jumping and climbing backwards into the crowd to escape the movement. From the outside, one could only see a massive wooden spike adorned with hay and charms bowing and bending over the heads of the excited onlookers. A spirit, a creature of the savannah’s grass and straw, had appeared in the crowd, and with defenses high had challenged the officials to combat. This was all staged, a fake showdown between nature and man. The creature was a living haystack, 7 feet tall, with no discernible figure or form, and when it moved, it absorbed the spike into its mass, then somersaulted on the ground, appearing like a live tumbleweed, a fast-motion hurricane, a spinning top set loose from its string. It kicked up sand, tornadoes of it, and sent the whole crowd into a fit of coughs and covered mouths, teeth dug into the sleeves of forearms.</p><p>From outside the crowd emerged new rivals. With costumes similarly made of shaggy colored grass, these had forms and faces, a massive gorilla of jet black hay with a paper mache face and a rainbow suit meant to represent the birds of heaven. As they competed with the grass in rounds of dance, little skirmishes cropped up at the sides of the circle. At one point, two completely orange beasts wearing the masks of demons entered into combat with a woman in red, both parties made giant by their costumes, and they would clang massive machete knives together and beckon to each other, pushing one another to the perimeter where children would scream and flee backwards, but even adults would recoil and make space. There was a palpable, playful fear.</p><p>Soon, the beasts of nature vanished, and instead a gendered dance took center stage, wherein women would come forward and, with knees bent low and arms bent high, kick up dust like pistons, their ankles shooting straight up in rapid relay. The men would counter with their own dancer, and a duel of affection played out in flat-footed flashes of drum and rhythm, pounding each other into the ground by sound and motion. Someone felt sick and we left.</p><h3 id="Seeing-the-Birds"><a href="#Seeing-the-Birds" class="headerlink" title="Seeing the Birds"></a>Seeing the Birds</h3><p>The next morning, I woke up to see the birds. Sitting on my cabin porch before the sun had risen, only a few pilots cued their morning songs; instead, the world was burdened by a loud, low hum of hundreds of bees collecting pollen from the abundant flowers.</p><p>By the time the first signs of light touched the canopies of nearby palms, an orchestra of birds had started warming up. They spoke stilted, they spoke sweet: they spoke lilted, and they spoke meek. Overhead, large birds of prey glided over the small town, doubtless heading to the river for early morning snacks, and in front of me an array of intrepid craftsmen took back the trees. Bullying the bees, faux-hummingbirds overburdened by fattened wings and plain beige bellies hovered in front of flowers; meanwhile, some long-beaked, pear-shaped songbirds flew into the tops of palm trees and bit down hard on the tops of those tall leaves. They would flutter for a second, trying to clip a spot in the veins, and then let their wings stop, plummeting a few feet to pull a single, thin strand of leaf loose from the full form, an ingredient for a nest with which they would triumphantly fly away, back into the orchestra.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Zq3CwfUlCJIZGzW4NpbUYnblzyMNOu-KUITFGa0jU-_Rp1FdibdJiKdH8fp_Bnzk_pEWoiKDza6S9UOrWhytofoR8ite8qeVyXltvNM9asmdMsbC59gu-msdf9uwuVgLwYdqUTf0RO3gbsbqAUfQq4UwMGOZUnNH8Zu0qhxJGHTEubogDO406H26kzZWrLFURN1q8RCeQLKmFomhcnTbhc3YOMF4wz6h4p2ULqC5NT6cExIk3Eai3-ap_abJjM1NAbej_oCtZ5WLEMU9omX08M1bJHImt9gpEH1z0kVZwKTsix-qpAGhMvjslUt0M6gzcCWrIpJ4MnsCtCuJHFLwhRXna-mwICCsnbrcB3ta-FP4Ve7h0TI2Iufy-re4v8QEQSyox7M6_JLUFqBAdTkSsIVC0ciIXRPM__e42L5YgXnfPuswkl-Kf5Milrq9bsFR3u0OQ27ieel6auOs7T0nZRcURmQetcohP-dcZhJMGv995x-6ACGaHCUk23Ab51e9-GP0sNKGlN3Pqw17PCNT1d2aV8KQ99XF5QaguaMq_341AMz3A2mKysHzX6_z4-9YQGPqe4-BfRR4550A2s7zMJC9RQul9wpxLHV1sPA0A4hAnqaBa0HCgNCnvyQwSXCJwlgAqQ1AF5V2LYhU0QfaCTHkwOmUEof4ehHrcO46a4YvSRs1od5tCRpfmmeGhAFtKdUglbmA5WNwxl6uXzlpvjgLGeHvmOZOnKQKfv0iM5qMoovS=w1157-h867-no" alt="only the lonely"></p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QeveEQ1k3l8FTim2czPZ-WXKKYrbxpcPVpdMN6uKV4yBlleMNzH8adHV1BPmYuU4yRrY2nsnMBVPZjEmDA1BFutJrkdyONSRqK6g88p3QpJfs8l21P1GXDW1ESPEW8DbVoaAM6sNiGbxt3Bd5haVNyTerpaAV4aTpQ5ruO9sndnWk30rpIjH4ezev1XctphhM57YDVnD_6lpGtbCCm7hZDz9NV9aGsY09m1ifN9xn354BsRALpOUnXQqTBb89PLDDELhAATKYZDVvxjzxDINsa7iyH_nCIkvUwnnpZRd93vKt_pjg1lwd0g9f0uOxLERtwFlXFim-F4pDA_y5SixxfiPOgcObSEoEN18-CJSCoW_qjUQp_liGEwI6A_BSgzYBK9bLuCETJVojVPuPygDk7eMlIv3OLPzfke0ptF4rXqSF0eGjZ_2cU7L5P6YW5b-XUgL1LBDLZcQ7FIj4Od3R_vPlV4nMZqBF7iIMD7l6TY8Gjt-pXj6bUzP9c2k6PzcFV12izwXaS95EaY3e0SKbYl9P4S9JyMWuL66wF47lTKdImW2OT_YToRspGrpRuOlE4EkODh11W85rNQ5xJgVWE6ln8t50Ohza9Y1te1JrYvAcJTNSxMinXNSDJRtujAeiJ4UXWiCKYHFQJwLxdfLUG5cFhQ1GcBAg69EI7tt4A_RlPGOe9tUOCKc6vriefV-Dw1DHcD1XKAvn2Tc4TYtkSg7BCKkk_pVqKI_-L77U-v59_7n=w1157-h867-no" alt="he pull"></p><p>Deep blue onlookers perched on top of buildings, and chickens hobbled across the road. On wingspan, the colors of the sun were carried to town in order to set the day in motion. MPC and I decided to actually visit Toubakouta.</p><h3 id="The-City-Redacted"><a href="#The-City-Redacted" class="headerlink" title="The City (Redacted)"></a>The City (Redacted)</h3><p>In Senegal, a commonly held value is <em>teranga,</em> which means “hospitality.” People speak of teranga the same way that Americans might speak of democracy or justice: more than just an ideal, it is present in not only the nation’s travel brochures but also in the way that people live their lives and politicians make their pitches. People want teranga to be true.</p><p>While I am frequently given the tourist treatment, the general conceit that people here are overwhelmingly friendly and accommodating is noticeable. On the beach, strangers will ask about my work or country of origin, and soon a small crowd of random folk will be locked in conversation that slips from French to Wolof to English and back again, joking and swapping stories. At home, guests will refuse to visit only one person, insisting that everyone joins in the conversation. The man who I buy bread and toothbrushes from knows me by name, and if we see each other outside of his shop, he’ll make sure to say hello.</p><p>And so I wandered. We walked into town, past the pregnant goats milling about piles of burning trash, over the fleets of chicks stumbling after their mother, around the tourist trap market stalls adorned with authentic merchandise imported from the same seller as the ones in Dakar, and across the road from where the lone police car guarded the slumbering Europeans. We entered the back passageways of concrete homes unpainted and undecorated, the overgrown fields of garbage and reckless brush, and the clothesline mazes of wooden huts. We were greeted with “peace be upon you” and “how are you doing?” until we encountered a young girl and her albino rabbit tucked between a few houses where men were whittling and cooking. I asked her, “Is this your rabbit?” and she replied, bluntly, “This is a rabbit.” Awa and I talked a little in French while MPC took pictures of the bunny, the first we’d seen since coming here, and then the men became interested in the foreigners conversing with a little girl in their backyard.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/18tfonciWEbEmH2RGWwab9C8bWD6L95SRTNyuERB8ay8euuFKZgvh3WDXLUGm5wF7ZZVefUoPRc3RbteGJvUNBssyeq7wiez0pYc0tt69bJHqyW37ZJsbXUFXcQP-j1PwfR-FvkMdsEDhb67noQyrkNSgOSnI1wjI3fJqkz-MXCOfw-dGQWk6AR1A0KoPUjDw2YoiVkdtSQ_2EbR1IElFngNTcNNQot4kyIZ3n3s-ChGeEj0uGy0h0UOpXjgFTCEpjBnlSdWDFmdRLtnVuc20Xg35j-pvG7iMpTbfmIF-DZEFqkCCa56JK0fG68bHzeXNXZgUVq_I3n9XJcA-tWiQ6BRTt4WwcacboU5d_esVc66mBK14FSnpOY6kZNfqDAnOupwAsthugx6ZPyBzgBUYX5nXGXAkosWLa5kCmdRCKofH06ii8-Dtm8sHXlqJTfe0jrZpCWlUYYBB08bCP_YHm8gHGar2hTjuf0CF0_gGiHgucN3j8P8rydyxQQ-9pThWqrarfPkNRA70ORT5mULkrNs1OnkwOb6ftCEKUX0iz5CngaARinb70SlJ3lYMvYMhyTxhROAD7YKwnG-VigJaY2pFIEReiNNIgLS9paUpFHpL3cVshjDz15MxY4MjrSOrR06x0DwaF1kylrZOurWfH8ZsAHFWTtqFF-TR2HaraAUL_ap0Ayd0TyDuAWEpwsveBjtKjPFQThvb4-rkAUBQvKYSqk9u-GfOz13Ho4Ijj3HN-uc=w1157-h867-no" alt="a young girl&#39;s rabbit"></p><p>I explained that we were students staying a little ways down the road and had just gone for a walk. I mentioned, protectively, that we knew Malang, a local who lived around here. At that, their ears perked up.</p><p>Another fact about Senegal. You have two names at a minimum. Last names distinguish ethnic origin, and there are only a dozen or so that one commonly hears. First names memorialize family members, and there are maybe 30 or so that one commonly hears. Sometimes, first names recall multiple family members, which means that people have multiple first names, and sometimes, people want to preserve their ethnic history, so they keep their maiden ethnic names. Thus, full names are often 2, 3, or 4 of the most common words you ever hear in Senegal grouped together. Fatou Maguette Fall, Maguette Fatou Kasse, Awa Fall Diop, etc. What this means, ultimately, is that <em>everyone has the same first name as everyone else.</em> Once, after meeting a man on the beach, he gave me his full name to look up on Facebook. It garnered hundreds of results, most without profile pictures.</p><p>So when I said Malang, they immediately pointed to a house behind us and said, “Oh, Malang!” Someone said something to someone, and in a few minutes, a Malang, but not our Malang, appeared in front of us. We said hello, and I joked, “A different Malang.” “Oh!” someone exclaimed, and pointed to another home, at which point I started to describe our Malang, who was notable for his university education, and they quieted down. Had I not, we might have become witness to an endless stream of Malangs, each equally uninterested in knowing us. With an awkward French “We’re just going to be on our way,” we bid farewell to the rabbit and fled.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d4Y9FpX7zyJ7z7Z10zVmw62a8CVhcUq-wv-jp_-cNamdM5F73pIof5Dz50Nxjf21IpYPzcgRTTJ8nr9TE1heI8I5G4WV5p-FPKDNGsu_lgyYJGpZahIrVo7SDEf8jz9r726kBK6upnQhRiTR9zjKi5piCSr121aW6jyNi2Cag1EzVeQ7aYCqgeWRDuPY7gwbnmypUlsZadWugi03qpsRhVTN2xlrdXoewA9M17TJhyzT141ELfL0-SNNRP5wKLmwcdhUz2z3OOhT4Cn9m4J5x9Pu__fS_3j9bj_vGcAozN_O7I9MtKfWNkITro3Ia1pLZ1RjZYaqFVoYT00sLgf0XCkMcu3CfLHfLdzmJJHU0FyqqkSlhhUmerAw46s3PE7OcZH_HDA6zbQ_ZAMugeW244vQwWQtqItb7PuAWxrQZxvsSKZ7c03JsNbqh-erbtDBz_QqonYsiKqh1XFoWUm6hW1PDoN72Bg4Y1Tdmx05FcZF_bhIZjb0emazvu4FsVPV5wkPAVmaju6jN1z_NbfToc3R-TLK_9UL-GUPhJme7FAHAbEVdrAq9QfjZAMn096h7g1kv-VawIbpqKspaLiRb_IYy_Fa2x1Y3Z_jhvvlJ7KqUY0rfSYf-KfxQDHJqUgpXnHqG17LBi7WI0JjJAP5PKsCGaMS7cDff4x6535L_NOpE6Co1S20zapVaj9rVtZHkX8lCL6rY_yxrjARrtbCmRMfb0cEEnan7hp93C4dYpL97Y6Z=w1157-h867-no" alt="goats battle" title="i bet on the losing goat"></p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gxXrjGALSedJNzs7JPz8uJxmqCVVJXgwdqnXzuieB2SgDrDMchOgGsLheouq_Xw0O59OkygtwxLhvjnJsjIfEaEO80oDiH3-zgQriyR6kEBrqfrtSHixSLbcWXbZ-IkXEBzIenk7vhSlCCEZjUWpxLNhzpoO3LQQrukyLLO2s-zcQ9x-q4h_eYa2exyzr8hdgQqquCRbaLKB1ySAZqE5cga4v_-x40CCVPxmGMRnw4y0GxrllfakPrHBC79ZlYqzvYLMD1MGM32VVy2kd1gRb1ypQwQFYQqhmzxE8VGc1fFKpsjLxzOS6fFRsjcaKWR74xtP6VaSCetZkGbjQYUy7xAWx2qzUU-UvQoXmBizK1_OqloIp2zlRSeWB9o7iW9L_NYUBOT64W5TDdkGnpsu4hfZRK6-HDeB3QXTpBn-RK43GTK6OF1D3rZhWI7JFuzsPlA4LRluPmMwrMJoWiwQC0uEVu5tr3g7ZB3B1Dss-5mKL_RnmG0QFHIjGneTSQLVb7h9MONBGL7oc8UXP2njKhpeHkgV8Q370grH-EYvpXdyi6b0SrLtMSD6dqLDiFDt1ufgl30MrEsfrVq6N5oIuuz9ZF7nhBjBZQMzElLEFAgbrqByrKYYKhhSrX9Aqfr9zhyGF5SAf7m7yHnPVJ5tK-l15l0XpLyCotoL_vyfX6qRD8N2Yo5pXj1CYdFhldyoajuM4idvCM6rXcvia4FAAzWOK1XxEI4ELml4XkKE0yJOQIML=w1157-h867-no" alt="battle continued" title="i&#39;ve always been for the underdog"></p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/U2R2zaoZZiDHOkLKk6O3TIxzzkVOIekM5Ty3zv9YYw555dow19Zv-b-1xjPk6FgJZx7JHGCjq446dBNRE-nntO_5PLIlUQk7Fz_VXuWNIV_CgEmPFwZaoFV0m0Wd7Dp4pJgQTwQrw659NLp9QB9Ow8-UFWKZwynG902nr5ya5pOw_Y5dtuD99Xm1gvhJjqNbY-YDflsSI2PtLjWPkb-UFrcixXNIGmh-bcftqLQKZOhy5hUvCI0y_NdbNubmx_0RJr00RtW0ycZohSXDPE_vkWk-bNMV1YOI5weTJnBaEFY3SXe2QqO5jvLKPDDLfGdKboykqxY1JrpyvY0qfTQyPwgBhUAwtmgP_OJTKK8JDleTRVunvAlvMMieb98VzkOKPUZSFpkCzWUNy3ZzMGS8Ny1SH0uWsLvPP602IKNXFOAye2PHbVYnF5PztyTYLqGdX4NnqxygMTF9Vk0lpyP-fBiK_xj5aE_oU6JEym8zK3r9MQqfvY33PjMDSwG6n41Bn5-kT8oVgzS6xA_GsaJO6bm2Or7D3aNwRRIj6VXPHwxGosEIuK1dVo2Gm6u-XnvYeibKRw_zCtd2O3xPcjdQgD7XM9YMquRQvMg8YSog_bSsLWAyFkY0pd0zQcB5Y0nTP6TpJqiOMRnu5TgjpakI-PQElQhreCDtaBfKcCHvNpuaUuvN5rL1DZvpN68_yzwLeNUb1EGFSeqPtDPoiU-PZ3uGmfdQrBtHxntNHcH2YUU_6XFt=w1157-h867-no" alt="the saddest donkey" title="the saddest donkey this world has ever seen"></p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KChPELckAOwzV6KGgovKvjvsP7WVSTKJF838Lu7ehjhHFaDfYKZ9Pf1k9Vq136ZR2UXE8gorKiXtpn4ONBpzFwI5YEONzWLiLP1JrEQglDrOtUF4Yaa-reUkbzLlWeHu5hG7hJdGFVqMCt8nCYjAxXVxstpdwMUhgf4k8qQhcBq902iVdR-BQr-bzyl-Zv0BT-pbsfRS1cWJA7gr34vdy08S_lZqdjPaAjB_iWYfrBtSc_3M7g_FRmdaWYepZIiCN87TUA96jVA2NwSmjPn1-AQfgQGA36SG7ouKmW0oxEe1G7GwC3DkXp-zbYZobySppcZdb4tuOHytLufb87V3UxcAViIKc1j7KpTGxG8QO0M2wrsRL_YhBvxU0YYb2yx_a4cNYUW6Gqab_A_aowLMYxHzPqBVjK7g8JYxsHLMlqwFXTcXU8LtlZt2wEVWj-NhwcvXTZo7wG7UJDxqVMusats29jSeXpFLRCxSFp4kqsI1pBA1YYqO6NkJ3eNn21OeWNnGhDDvkmXBhIcNQSIO0mDQXRZhB3tsXZPl-Xjp_tN39wYAhVsOiLcSg2WnXQ4jIlhydMely2W0I9AVr0D6c9rm6Qx-h2Gg-6SN-KFwjcqOo5yYdXPhghtyjr5f46bW8WuIpOOZzGS5UJp2i17SfY8RJxp9j-6C5V0Bdccz9XrrKOB1bQAoDZOSmDSAtZIruzLnUWbOzUCgfkKYYuc-Oj_QcrxqGZB7aL6Tf6jE_-KT8MRC=w1157-h867-no" alt="some old houses"></p><h3 id="There-is-No-Authority"><a href="#There-is-No-Authority" class="headerlink" title="There is No Authority"></a>There is No Authority</h3><p>We took a bus back to Kaolack. Luckily, there is no story there. After paying (our) Malang, packing our things, and saying goodbye to our hotel staff, we piled into another 14-seater for a short trip back to Kaolack. Again, we were stopped by a random man in a robe who penned down the number of occupants, and while this would happen multiple times, no one would explain why to us.</p><p>When we arrived at the bus station, which is not where we had originally been dropped off, we found ourselves at the base of someone’s apartment building, someone who presented himself in a yellow and red track suit and drank from a coffee mug.</p><p>In an upcoming economy like Senegal, distinctions for legal authority or occupation are really uncommon. The only people who wear uniforms are police officers, the military, and fast food workers at Western chains. Otherwise, people are always plain clothes, always relaxed. The only reason we knew this place was the bus station was the bus parked outside of it. Otherwise, it was just the first floor of a man’s apartment building. Across from his office was a kitchen, and in his office was a mattress. Random inhabitants entered and left, and we took his fancy handheld ticketing device as proof enough that he must be the guy in charge.</p><p>I slept on the bus ride back.</p><p>As for us, there is no authority. After organizing the cross country trip, dealing with tickets and hotels and translators, and navigating the trials and tribulations of a French-less casual economy, I immediately took a wrong turn as we walked back from the Dakar bus station to our respective host families. From there, MPC took the lead.</p></div><footer class="article-footer"><a data-url="https://peterforberg.github.io/2020/02/02/The-Road-to-Toubakouta/" data-id="ck650i56v0000m8tzcx8y4k4a" class="article-share-link">share</a></footer></div></article><article id="post-On-Kids-in-Cars-and-Cars-and-Kids-in-Cul-de-sacs" class="article article-type-post" itemscope itemprop="blogPost" data-scroll-reveal><div class="article-inner"><header class="article-header"><h2 itemprop="name"><a class="article-title" href="/2020/01/20/On-Kids-in-Cars-and-Cars-and-Kids-in-Cul-de-sacs/">On Kids in Cars and Cars and Kids in Cul-de-sacs</a></h2></header><div class="article-meta"><a href="/2020/01/20/On-Kids-in-Cars-and-Cars-and-Kids-in-Cul-de-sacs/" class="article-date"><time datetime="2020-01-20T15:14:22.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">2020-01-20</time></a></div><div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>Peter Forberg</em></p><p>In elementary school, we’d often take field trips to <em>Chicago,</em> the big-city-far-away place that meant stuffing our labeled brown bag lunches into an industrial-sized green plastic bin and splitting into groups to explore places like the Art Institute, Field Museum, or Shedd Aquarium. If you were cool enough by charm or lucky enough by assigned seating, you could end up in the back seat, where an easy way to pass the time involved waving at the cars behind you from the window of the emergency exit door. Here we played rock-paper-scissors with commuters, fired fake guns at drowsy travelers, and begged for truckers to blow their horns. It is with this carelessness, this excitement, and this curiosity that children are allowed to engage the world and its inhabitants, fueled by an unbridled friendliness that can forget about the lack of make-believe in the real world. They’re allowed to be kids.</p><p>An especially rewarding moment for me was driving down the Dan Ryan behind a school bus and watching as kids on the bus armed themselves with finger guns, shooting at me as I tailed behind. I feigned death, clutching my chest, and, because buses drive slowly, moved into the next lane. The children, stunned at my participation, ran forward on the bus and reappeared at the side windows, now aiming their pistols into the open air. I played back, taking a few potshots, and then accelerated out of view.</p><p>Another day, a few months later, I found myself waiting in the deli line, ticket in hand, at the Jewel Osco in Woodlawn. This time, two kids sat in a shopping cart outfitted to be a racecar, with fake steering wheels mounted to the plastic seats. They swerved, leapt barriers, and avoided traffic. Soon, however, they noticed me, and, as the little boy said, “He’s white! It’s the police. Shoot him!” Again, I found myself in a duel, but, knowing my place, I let them gun me down and collapsed to the floor of the Jewel Osco, their mother appalled at my decision to take part in their game. But they laughed, and the little sister was happy to have been a good getaway driver.</p><p>In both cases, the children were black.</p><p>Now I find myself in a predominantly black country, knowing for the first time what it means to be stared down as I walk the streets at any time of day. Sometimes in Chicago, especially in places like ALDI or Jewel Osco, I’ll get a few looks, even a few comments, but ultimately, the people there know that they don’t live in a black country. My whiteness might be unwanted, but it isn’t surprising. Here, I am a surprise. In the same way that most of us students are surprises. Asian students are greeted with “Nihao” when entering into marketplaces, while I mostly just get asked for my country of origin. Still, most of the time, nothing is said. Instead, people do double-takes, point and stare, or take photographs. But not children.</p><p>Children are amazed by us. Recently, the lot of us (who are mostly not black) were packed into a bus and drove through the city as school was let out. Kids on buses screamed, opened windows, pointed, and laughed. Kids on the street stopped to take pictures. When walking down the street, kids in the backs of cars will follow us for as long as possible, moving in their seats to look out the back window and watch us disappear. At a concert, Nick held his phone out into the air, recording the stage. Little kids pulled at him, and one tried talking to me in French. “People will steal it,” he said. If we talk to them on the streets, as they will sometimes ask us how we are, every response, no matter how mundane, will be met with laughter.</p><p>And kids are on the streets. In a forthcoming post, I’ll talk about how this is often not a good thing, but for the kids who can choose to enter and leave the streets as they please, the city of Dakar is their’s for the taking. Growing up in a cul-de-sac, I knew the fun of having a big open space to claim for yourself, but there was a clear line of demarcation that separated the world of children from the world of adults. In Dakar, that line blurs. Children roam around concerts, hang out in stores, build soccer arenas in alleyways, town squares, and streets of sand. They hijack mopeds, heckle tourists, and play on the beach. They are wild, unbound, and hopeful. And so I relish their taunts and sideways glances; I look forward to the dropped jaws. I am amazed with how they are allowed to interact with this world, questioning and pointing and laughing and interrogating the things that pass them by, not allowed to go unnoticed though surely to soon be forgotten when a new mood moves in.</p></div><footer class="article-footer"><a data-url="https://peterforberg.github.io/2020/01/20/On-Kids-in-Cars-and-Cars-and-Kids-in-Cul-de-sacs/" data-id="ck5mle3me0000vwtze0p00v52" class="article-share-link">share</a></footer></div></article><article id="post-On-Camelback-a-Sea-of-Salt" class="article article-type-post" itemscope itemprop="blogPost" data-scroll-reveal><div class="article-inner"><header class="article-header"><h2 itemprop="name"><a class="article-title" href="/2020/01/19/On-Camelback-a-Sea-of-Salt/">On Camelback, a Sea of Salt</a></h2></header><div class="article-meta"><a href="/2020/01/19/On-Camelback-a-Sea-of-Salt/" class="article-date"><time datetime="2020-01-19T22:13:17.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">2020-01-19</time></a></div><div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>Peter Forberg</em></p><p>The pink lake is poorly named. From far away, the highly reflective surface looks like any other lake, if not more silvery than most, casting clouds and the canopies of trees into its mirror. Up close, the water is a murky reddish brown, like a watered down mole sauce. But from the right angle, at the perfect time of day, the wind will cause little waves of light to reflect the midday’s overbearing sun, and standing at its shore, one can see a pink glow in the distance, shining like an ethereal sea of pepto bismol. The pink lake is aptly named.</p><p>The color is caused by algae. The lake is filled with salt. At a maximum depth of 3 meters, 1.5 of those meters are salt. While I disagree that it is impossible to drown in, it’s mostly for wading. Those who harvest the salt, men usually, cover themselves in shea butter to prevent the salt from damaging their skin. They wade out with their boats and scoop the salt into them until they reach a weight of about a tonne. Then they bring them to shore where they sell the salt to women. Women have first dibs on selling the salt to large companies that then ship it around the world. Huge mounds of salt lay in the sun to dry.</p><p><img

Tangled threads criss-cross over rolling sand dune and glance past rocky bluff, trapping small palm trees in the space between asphalt and fence, routing traffic down endless roads that disappear into the horizon where the sea meets the dust, and creating small mazes embedded within labyrinths where cornerstore boutiques duplicate themselves like a prison of mirrors that obscures your way home. At dusk, the city becomes a puzzle, the neon signs of pharmacies and wine shops flickering on, hot pinks and morning greens combatting the orange hue of a setting sun that will soon cast citizens deep into an unforgiving, starless night. Baobab trees, the untouchable symbol of the nation protected from axe and chainsaw, spring from parks, interrupt intersections, and grow into the sides of apartment buildings. Under the cover of their branches, city dwellers walk home from work, quick to bolt the doors behind themselves.</p><p>In this crowd of commuters, a tourist finds himself wandering the haphazard streets, pulled along by the swarm of those who know better than him Dakar’s aimless paths. But he is a sore thumb. From out of the sea emerges a figure who extends his hand and offers a common greeting, “Salam aleykoum.” <em>Peace be upon you.</em></p><p>On another street, at another time, on another path walked through the maze, a student is commiserating with the folks she meets, her eager desire to experience the city from the eyes of its inhabitants guiding her words, an endless stream of “How are you?” and “Nice to meet you.” He sees her, too. He extends his hand with an open palm and soon peace is upon her.</p><p>The tourist is being led down a series of sharp turns, propelled forward by the mystic’s words of warning, his insistence that the tourist must follow him, an unwavering belief that the two know each other and must help each other. Fed lie after lie, the tourist doesn’t know what to believe, and finds himself brought into boutiques and stores and storage centers, unsure of how he could initiate an exit should things go south. They’ve already gone south, and soon he finds himself in front of an ATM.</p><p>The student is clutching her necklace, a family heirloom, and pulling it off of her neck, gingerly placing it into the open palm of the man before her. “More,” he suggests, and her feet abide. The two are walking back to her home where she lives with a Senegalese family, and now they are ascending the staircase, passing by maid and mother wordlessly into the rooftop terrace where she’s hidden her treasures from home.</p><p>The tourist struggles to remember this part. <em>Why didn’t I leave? Why didn’t I catch him in his lies? Why would I agree to do this? How could I be so stupid?</em> Here’s the ATM, his card in hand, and here he is dispensing bills, more money than he’s willing to admit. Gone. Dispensed into the waiting palms of a family friend, perhaps a neighbor, or perhaps a demon in disguise.</p><p>Jewelry, money, technology–it’s all given over to the mystic. He asks and she complies. She unloads her valuables into his arms and he is pleased. When asked, she’ll describe the haze, the fogginess, the feeling that she wasn’t in control of her own body. She’ll try to give details, but the particulars escape her.</p><p>In both cases, the police will understand. The families will look on in horror. Their Senegalese contacts–employers, teachers, relatives–they’ll all ask the same question: <em>Before all of this happened, before he took everything away from you, did he shake your hand?</em> They’ll gasp. They’ll scream. They’ll bow their heads in sympathy. <em>The Mystic,</em> they’ll proclaim.</p><p>With an open palm, he’ll extend an invitation for him to rest in your brain. If you accept, he will take your body away from you. But he won’t stop there. Tourists, students, unsuspecting children–he preys on those too polite or naive to decline a greeting from a stranger. And then things will get stranger.</p><h2 id="A-Truth-That-Unites"><a href="#A-Truth-That-Unites" class="headerlink" title="A Truth That Unites"></a>A Truth That Unites</h2><p>During our first few days in Dakar, we were briefed on some stark cultural differences that may manifest in our interactions with the Senegalese people who we meet, and so were informed to be wary of offense. For example, greetings are a large part of Senegalese culture, so it’s rude to enter a home without formally greeting the people living there, even if you are counted among them. A few key mantras were roughly translated to us from Wolof, and I will do my best to recap them here:</p><blockquote><ul><li>You are not controlled by time; you control time.</li><li>It is better to be fearful than feared.</li><li>Love can be tough, sometimes physically. (To be fair, this was eloquently put in Wolof, something about a mother animal having to hit their child to demonstrate poor behavior.)</li><li>Without your fellow man, you are defenseless. You must accept your position then in a community of protectors.</li><li>The more a mother suffers, the more a child will succeed.</li><li>A lie that unites is better than a truth that divides.</li></ul></blockquote><p>The last mantra suggests the power of a relative truth, something which exceeds what we call “white lies.” These are powerful, lasting lies that can alter one’s knowledge of the world. Having run this phrase by my host sister, she agreed that it is best to be dishonest if it protects another person’s feelings. The man who told us of this mantra gave us the example of an affair: if his friend was cheating on his wife, he would not tell the wife; instead, he would tell his friend to stop cheating or be honest himself. Of course, while this rule of “ignorant bliss” is what the Senegalese consider best practice, it’s certainly not routinely applied. For an American example, see: <em>treat others the way you want to be treated.</em></p><p>Regardless, it’s how I want to approach the story of the mystic, which was recently invoked by one of our professors due to the experience of a student at our research center. Talking to this student, he immediately admitted that the events that unfolded were likely his own fault, and that he was just put in a difficult social situation that he wasn’t sure how to get out of. Similar to my experience at Sandaga Market, his status as a tourist, his desire to be kind, and his sense of adventure landed him in a place where there was no easy way out. However, after telling the story to the police, our handlers, and his family, they all immediately asked if he had shaken hands with the man. When he said yes, they relaxed. This wasn’t the case of a naive tourist, this was the case of a hypnotized victim manipulated by ancient magic.</p><p>Because I tend not to believe in the preternatural, it seems logical that the mystic became an easy way to explain one’s way out of a stupid mistake: drawing on the immensely religious Sufi spirit of Senegal, one could point to longheld myths about magical men and unexplained mysteries to recontextualize what were really just skillful muggings. It makes victims blameless, and it reaffirms any tourist’s conception of the strange, “other” continent as filled with magic and myth. An enterprising victim might play into this lie in order to look less stupid, and the police might play into this lie in order to make the victim feel less stupid. Either way, it is a fiction that makes the entire situation much more manageable. Rather than confronting head-on the troubles of Senegalese crime or the naivite of tourists, one can push human psychology into the realm of unexplainable magic.</p><h2 id="A-Way-to-Say-Hello"><a href="#A-Way-to-Say-Hello" class="headerlink" title="A Way to Say Hello"></a>A Way to Say Hello</h2><p>While standing in the living room talking to my host father and a few other various people, a young girl who I had never seen before walked up to me and extended a hand. I didn’t really notice her and continued talking until my host father looked at me seriously and said, “Shake.” Suddenly, the room went quiet as I shook her hand. Wordlessly, she walked to every person in the room, shook their hands, and then walked out. Everyone resumed talking. Papa turned to me and said, “You must shake.” Then he jumped back into conversation like nothing had happened.</p><p>When I told Nick the story of the mystic, it was late at night and we were going to the terrace. I left him to get his laundry from the clothesline, and when I came back he screamed. The mystic. I wonder how he slept that night.</p></div><footer class="article-footer"><a data-url="https://peterforberg.github.io/2020/01/18/The-Mystic/" data-id="ck5jydkjv0000vgtze062003d" class="article-share-link">share</a></footer></div></article><article id="post-Jerry-Seinfeld-Lives-in-Dakar-and-He-Can-t-Get-a-Driver-s-License" class="article article-type-post" itemscope itemprop="blogPost" data-scroll-reveal><div class="article-inner"><header class="article-header"><h2 itemprop="name"><a class="article-title" href="/2020/01/16/Jerry-Seinfeld-Lives-in-Dakar-and-He-Can-t-Get-a-Driver-s-License/">Jerry Seinfeld Lives in Dakar and He Can&#39;t Get a Driver&#39;s License</a></h2></header><div class="article-meta"><a href="/2020/01/16/Jerry-Seinfeld-Lives-in-Dakar-and-He-Can-t-Get-a-Driver-s-License/" class="article-date"><time datetime="2020-01-16T21:21:12.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">2020-01-16</time></a></div><div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>Peter Forberg</em></p><p>Today I saw Americans. I see Americans everyday, but the quietly neurotic Americans that I see everyday have gone through several rounds of vetting to end up as the type of people who decide to take a break from their intensive studies at an elite private university by floundering about in a completely foreign African nation instead of downing wine at a French vineyard under the guise of cultural immersion for academic credit on their parents’ dime. We aren’t the standard fare, despite our flaws.</p><p>I’ve never really thought about Americans abroad aside from those who actively choose to go into fields like foreign service or humanitarian aid. They’re the kind of people I would routinely dismiss as too deeply invested in the “project of American globalization” to care much about their roots, having anticipated that they would spend their working lives far from home. I did not expect, however, that on the shores of the western most point in Africa would wash up the type of flag-toting, freedom fries-munching, drawl-slinging homebodies who are somehow miffed that the country they have found themselves in isn’t the home of giant balls of rubber bands or kittycorner fast food restaurants. Instead, it is a developing nation without the capacity to accommodate rigid Western sensibilities.</p><p>I have to assume that such generalizations are incorrect, and in fact believe the majority of Americans abroad really do know what they’re getting themselves into and are, by all accounts, really quite lovely people. But really quite lovely people don’t make for good blog posts, so here we are.</p><p>I went to the embassy for a town hall. I went to the embassy for a town hall, and I’d like very much to say that it was a beautiful building, which is true, and I’d like very much to say that it was a big beautiful building that I was not allowed to photograph, which is also true. The provided images come from Google. Thanks Google, for being allowed to photograph the embassy.</p><p><img src="https://www.blharbert.com/assets/2016/01/DakarNEC_FeaturePhoto-1200x650.jpg" alt="our lovely embassy" title="alternatively, this is just a public high school from the north suburbs"></p><p>While waiting to get my passport checked at the gates to the embassy, I was joined by my fellow patriots whose particular New World quirks I had so regretfully forgotten. A woman, pale skin impeccably unburnt by the everlasting sunlight, wore a large, traditional African necklace, surely a sign of her cultural transformation, while a few spaces behind her stood a man in a floral Hawaiian button-up with khakis and a large sun hat ready for some R&amp;R on that fabled beach of swaying palm trees. At our feet, a small dog whose malnourished form was more akin to a hungry coyote crept through the crowd, flies circling his pockmarked hair which was torn around the edges. As a soft whimper emerged from his haggard frame, the Senegalese guests and the embassy employees gave the pup a wide berth, but naturally the kind-hearted American teenagers in line bent down to show him some love as ticks dropped from his back. Luckily, a wizened security guard snapped at the dog until he eventually limped away into the streets.</p><p>After a quick trot through a metal detector, I was in a little outdoor conference room where about 60 American citizens sat on folding chairs and shook hands with the ambassador, who was, from my limited exposure, incredibly kind and incredibly intelligent.</p><p>Let me pause here to say that I am not a fan of US imperialism. However, I am a fan of the United States working with foreign nations, especially those who have been mistreated by the West, in order to collaborate on projects that will increase the quality of life for the average citizen, and if in accomplishing this goal, private corporations profit in order to generate more jobs for these nations, that is not a bad thing. In fact, some might even say that a mutually beneficial exchange between the Senegalese economic sector and the US private sector moderated by the federal government is all in all good.</p><p>This should not, however, come in the form of KFC. Despite 500 million dollar deals for increased electrical infrastructure, the ambassador earnestly began his list of accomplishments by reminding us that Dakar is now home to the ultimate experience of “finger licking delicious” [sic] chicken, a true marriage of the US’s entrepreneurial spirit and Senegal’s…chicken.</p><p>After the ambassador, we were introduced to the head of regional security, who began his speech with a “howdy” and I’m going to stop myself here. I originally wrote unflattering depictions of these various diplomats. This is unfair. Everyone there seemed incredibly thoughtful about the work that they are doing; that they resemble extras for a Scarface remake is more indicative of the white world’s traditional imperialist role rather than its current humanitarian manifestation. They spoke of education, energy infrastructure, and health care. They seem like good people, and I admire that they have, by choice or assignment, began working for the people of Senegal by way of what I’m sure is an unforgiving bureaucracy called the State Department. Let not my youth excuse my perennial cynicism.</p><p>This is getting long so I’ll cut to the chase: there was a Q&amp;A. This Q&amp;A affirmed what I’ve long believed to be true. I am destined to be an expat. Early on, a woman innocently asked about a new law that seems to require American citizens to get a Senegalese driver’s license. Later, a man would stand up and, as if billed to perform a Netflix exclusive set at Madison Square Garden, joke endlessly about how these crazy Senegalese drivers were suddenly supposed to evaluate his 30 years of near perfect driving experience, mocking their lax attitude towards vehicular child safety and the driving patterns of car rapides, which are a completely unique and viable transit option that does occasionally stop in the middle of the street without warning. Granted, driving in Dakar is a nightmare. Roundabouts simulate the experience of being the silver sphere in a pinball machine, one-ways are unlabeled if even official, and curbs are only for those with a less imaginative understanding of the laws of physics. Importantly, however, this is what driving is in Senegal, and no one, not a single Senegalese person, is going to change the way they drive because an American drives differently.</p><p>Another man who might as well have been airdropped in from Nashville, asked the public affairs officer point blank if the embassy had a “soft power plan” for getting “real American music” to the people of Senegal. Now, while I can empathize with living in a foreign country and having no one to talk about Led Zeppelin with,<sup>1</sup> this frustration has not once granted me the cognitive dissonance and sense of superiority to assume that it is the United States Federal Government’s prerogative to proselytize the Senegalese public with Eric Clapton’s sweet licks. For anyone not familiar with “soft power,” a refresher: it’s cultural brainwashing. A short list of people familiar with soft power is provided here:</p><blockquote><p>racist colonizers</p></blockquote><p>Notably, Peter Gabriel is big in Dakar.</p><p>Our last American business owner abroad has caused me no personal offense. He was just wondering, after having filed company and personal taxes in Senegal for the past few years, whether or not he should also be filing taxes in the US. The short answer is that he may very well be required to file those taxes in the US, in which case, he did just admit to a room of federal employees that he has inadvertently been committing tax evasion. To him, I raise my glass.</p><p>I have no more jokes. I have only this plea: if you are at any point planning on moving to another nation, remember that that nation existed long before you came, and it probably likes the way that it has existed, and if it doesn’t, it is the people who live there who will decide if red lights are a necessary good or “Born in the USA” should become a cultural icon. But until that shift occurs, you might just want to stay at home.</p><p><sup>1</sup>I do not listen to Led Zeppelin, nor will I now.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HtA6S94XS_DCXsM86010jpFJceSY0EldA0WkhMbdOFDMQ-4V3JOSlnKtpRWQSymcL0OXRCPCxd2T7_d5cXrTzMdUeX_Sbg4bT2LToJty_iUQUKlDE3TmnAimoGsS6jcQa8XIlr8_ozOvk-7kNa5cKo27luY_6P7YmF6AQiabHa9H4xROku5nN1XYe2w_WrNQVGgnZvim-WXVWQotu88cj3T1Qi3e5uZtg8UrRYJ51MeNDTxVJPgwnTuolQxOUnNHc0Uy4_-WahV2nWslS0u6__NrZ3I4tiI_v1ChxNLv6GWCSW8rVNn9ceWviitCKtrKX9VPNkBEprOXoKPTdi3ZpeaadgsVcFbkN6tlVOcQSEgUKmI9cGDrE9u7QFjxnO4hZOJN4ubfGxGJrM_XaLp3-xzQkJacj5dupLCGockonw844ElTiHUj72JIwHlKTuCyXFRF5AO2-DhBh8sG79xGGqHYOv0whXcvthdfVToFM-InrE6xX4ruhvt_11gDlb5nQZng_C0h6S4HdiNhnAgIVA1mwTSfrmG1FELnki5x1OXCIldNeqCf4rMRwDGG7cIZXMS943Gign2zKv9NPvee4YHt1YR7XPZBvah68pEFt9pxj-ZYiHToVXQF857yuFTSuqcOWaXq0bIaMP9emmZB0V-gqhXvdh_SgKl_8SMi60cDxvBDPCoKe6LXge9XybwAOfJC7y8qMylr1YIYy5EZSj32V7LXccf3UQMVdeYfluf24_lP=w1157-h867-no" alt="US at the embassy" title="I don&#39;t know most of these people"></p></div><footer class="article-footer"><a data-url="https://peterforberg.github.io/2020/01/16/Jerry-Seinfeld-Lives-in-Dakar-and-He-Can-t-Get-a-Driver-s-License/" data-id="ck5h9a1gd0000gwtzayts1vkf" class="article-share-link">share</a></footer></div></article><article id="post-Tourist-for-a-Day" class="article article-type-post" itemscope itemprop="blogPost" data-scroll-reveal><div class="article-inner"><header class="article-header"><h2 itemprop="name"><a class="article-title" href="/2020/01/12/Tourist-for-a-Day/">Tourist for a Day</a></h2></header><div class="article-meta"><a href="/2020/01/12/Tourist-for-a-Day/" class="article-date"><time datetime="2020-01-12T11:15:02.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">2020-01-12</time></a></div><div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>Peter Forberg</em></p><p>In the northwest neighborhood of Ngor, the taxis stop at one roundabout and are not allowed any farther. This is a fishing village where generations of men have boarded boats and journeyed into the waves that spurn ambitious surfers at the island just off the coast. When we arrive, we navigate a maze of small, sandy alleyways until we find ourselves on the beach. Men unload thiof into ice boxes, young children scour the tidepools for signs of life, and adolescent boys slip and slide around a makeshift soccer field in the dry, unstable sand. We’ll return to this place, but for now we’re walking along the rows of fishing boats, skirting past small flocks of sheep, and interrupting games of jump rope—except it’s not jump rope. Instead, three girls stand equidistant from one another with a single long rope taut behind their backs, creating a woven triangle that can be as tall as the shortest girl, and then other girls jump over the rope into and out of the triangle, shoulders first like high jumpers.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/36S8QMkUHAPx6Jd0kFhrEmL_4Aax59lAoYKW3mP9h4IiOFxi8e03F9kUPl1fFggWwl_TSE6QVIAlzaETvEK_QHxLB3pi4H4BM4P31Xs1YZE5yoRDhLBS8iT9dqFZi5QvvQfjJACpa35rsUmgtTkSUTRhSdrbZsorS9dhWbMo40zrInyNl--iW7LcIMlCou8G1LPxWthXEAaQ75oyy-NiERAi5xGzDayS65X_SLpQxCgCLSTFSEMB5JynAfv2BK4P-bLAaI7WZyJ4ojfdAXWMez3mr0tOM5sM4pSS-HpCtIFCi8UsC4MUIRcOaWBlfrSH3sN5NQROls6nRMtc9bdVk-XCqIYeOeB977Y4YmI5cTC5K3oc3fGGCmnpD3kg3vejvMbT0By1UFXP2FimcyqZpAfY5DiHD46Ii7x35RJaoWZM0Wai3JR9DBa3xbXvgTfsMPVDWlcNM9tARA8aqTdnr9UP_at2F4z5fAklgsBUyevBmdNaY5NoIkXnuTd3F2lqLOKZne8vqCy0LzSCSBbsy7uibjbEDJvL4oREUFQktG4WqYKSU2yGokz17aJZt1hDcaMKBWS22RRhA_nUmCHWgVpHyQCxKDh9jyThmW6m170W4L1cS_OScdcRv8xz8p2IHWFNAeBa1t-2DQXdNvBn2mAro593isoioDNwq6beCTO-H4xX0qMKmXOBF4dP1lIEbYknnQCBBfCj7KkL-rcpIqTGM2rWxTYkFzT55AdXykJg6XrU=w1059-h794-no" alt="goats on patrol"></p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5CiNKnoIo2HAfjUTIcwFMmXlIHCEGqbGZP3NvJRnPzszrmf_0M0FK_cBkUsTet0N4hvry5aGILfT5sdfLqcpWbFWf-LJ4rBZgO9NLrqSdbXU2GU0TqAMljrSk712b_bTLN7iLEvbb5qJmmELpmK5aXgh2tQesrwkfBJ-1D39nMXH2OlD3ntrhUJoIhvl7W8cwXYFaOPPQj7heA9omISIaVEjDP6mIq4ouBI91MqumgMqiEyIRSZbaCU-_UhUHsWOoQTPDkVC0555ieweuNjFozIYJmskfVJWN6cxYY21bq8oQwzHA0zz2Ny9X-Uf1GP7XmRf5it5uJHBRH37sQBVmS_qjScX-5_M0z-CTfGi6lzHXA0hXJIUGEhnKtrJcmET2lGuZlWnTqIv2RWPhvT6nn34gEDHeeqXWZ4njh51X1m9KshDNZS7r3nNhcsw7mUHTtRwMG1chcU50pLhjivlniQt6QyWmNkb2_K_JmuYevFM64HqkkhJGKVUg_LpibwJCaXwOf9agMkNEDxDVMX3yEnkp0Fh_NhZ7p7jA5i-TRq9Z51mLm5YKPKj_woCYuAb_rLoAleuc9l7ommmvLodnAUkWK1QILwQX18zUVMvW8tFmvMqS-cVXUbiuylJxofYu8c0d0S_H55cu2Ol6OjNinM2n4YGtfUPRszJYWgkJkCPvIQLfJhD8yC1xnNFKie3VUCxVCRY_usBE1BBG84tNl8tnLMsSc_R_GQAr04aGfbs6S9M=w1157-h867-no" alt="boats on patrol"></p><p>A man on the beach approaches us and tells it to us straight: there are three ways to get from Ngor Beach to Ngor Island. You can swim. You can take a public boat. You can take a private boat. Opting for the option that is cheapest and least harmful to my body, we are soon strapping on life vests and climbing aboard a long wooden boat decorated with brightly painted nautical creatures and equipped with a small motor. As small, cold waves lap over the sides, I ask if anyone swims across. Only tourists, he says.</p><p>When I tell people here that I cannot swim, the reaction is always surprise. I expect as much, but today the reasoning is explained by a friendly surf instructor: “I know many black people who cannot swim, but your skin is white.”</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mjmq0y3vsxkiOQFy0Mrzi0klxP4FIaJwfmes8MIkT7BzgVipGhh2Y7DUlqUUSUyGbQIs_3SL1LcKPu8r6EFqoQrd0jgKtqmx9oRNiPpZObA4IbTS4367-SqrJvcDJmLYWr4yH_N9wfyLnBka99m8K0roKWVBHWZx7Sswmm6XRU2WD4ArAwfvQNy_Ye55idM6DLruyS-oHKjNaC7O4OSJK2QCdu9pZS2rDjJq6O_KYCh3RWsP20rOcj8_J7Js_bxLCfkQQSlX9dA_Se4h1JH1rVE58-46jXL1L_g-8Jo-1BE5nKtnp9vuNG_dFAx6sT6LuPC_SoxcgBwqSE5UnASVWHNojanDhdcLgohOAOZtOq5XYabL-3jtkIGYv7oMKG96uRolWgoht0kU5sH8JUDqo5vLIbKH1V-wcT7SGnUPUP56_8mZkXObMv_seCm0ODSl9O3asWmk8gwo2I1S5iwRFs2-Dj7h3m9NQw294lZx0ARAcGJhmHxxkYZjqyXWd-pi4tMbjHitktKwZNuD7kzcuaoeo6j1oTwJLlAmjLymdsu8Yi9RTCPfIi9e0bZ8YzQv1Bu5W42GVrTt2cO9kwFVyM4l9UiL80SgvBEPDi_YauSnjTibqCJCPge0b9p_1xO2y2F6nIaMBUdYlxXnxC3kb9GhtpAmmzQdjtaLOqRdp-9aqAb6QgCbWQX-7kR_WPmMFJtjH2oo6Bk5qCw8wuVMVBwFKZnS_b5Oo6b5wJJ8_Kdu6MeF=w1157-h867-no" alt="goodbye village"></p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OPsuBeTusJEo-77WGEDTxBPwlS0fNzto7bKvAZrV8PprYHbD6oW3iUPw4_ObiVOYa-aUXszrw1Kbxftw9F5vlwPAIlvAhvvpJIIjp4F96Q5Kckm3qKpio3h5Bzcc_nLwqUeABvC6ySW2dswRJJ1vXyc_gehHSvyQD4xHuf8tQXC3PMRBca9uxfHM-jSeXdMUhSznbZxLnPd371NzDYdxU7ClNCTwodzKJjx1Raa1M2_8yOKcn4T3tT4MVwVOsMbBV0eoJ6vOhdIdBmDvTY8DhhufxvmOG23rO1Yv3aX7y69LIthEDY1Ya0j9nr86nhM5ESyH_sxNYQ2EN8xuS_ia6jF4jgkScdwN0dFiJ0qeMjUT9GqbBbjGHUfqxYbPB47XH7XMBmQF9zuG7TWvK0mDUZksFazVYSCN8TYGS_R2PlrdVkj6ilkQv9GeOLhWn8M0cIXq-hesuqfM4SRXjVpQRRjv2LAT6mi58Fzi5xyLyULCUKl0Irc3jfBcvk9Y8TrL14Y2IiGhpShIRojhlp4TkO6LCY9yBKMIdQsWTDEWriHqbFMVlTvLSbq3SGVXaHvfCCv5mI_DKTkgAfycyI9c7Vm3O2tHiLVbex83MEb8n0wSe93Yp1f6IuIsGrwHTE5iy-p2koFAvQ8NQdIL8vLMufGxPPB4iv5WZ0kv28xO7vBbzI7i7piSfy5HK16mcn5p5xKr3bwB726c6lXBfWoaanL9KIRH5RL_OsIb8B5pI9nvGdm1=w1157-h867-no" alt="hello tourists"></p><p>Behind us, the quaint fishing village disappears, and ahead of us palm trees sway over long lines of beach lounge chairs and tropical umbrellas: Ngor Island. This is why the French come. The sun is high and little white children are romping around in the low waves. Tourists sit at restaurants built over the coast, downing fruity cocktails and stiff martinis. We’re immediately greeted by women balancing bowls of jewelry on their heads. The prices are laughable, but she still eagerly pulls out bracelet after bracelet, eventually offering a beaded thong “for the couples.” We push past the tourist sprawl to find ourselves once again winding down small roads, passing homes and hotels separated by high stone walls lined with the remnants of glass bottles. Here are million dollar homes hidden by the facade of earthy, handmade streets and ornate, “tribal” doors carved to depict the distant savannah or lion head.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yRrd0l7Ib_oYi7No7OcFPzq9kJ7jqfHuzWc4uguP2Ivy-7yeNZmmllgd81kQI0hrWwaLQ_8t6iGXGtZWTE5nZXl-pSYVR4bb5LRUPSNO3mOW9MYA2iKpgGGm2_5KsI2AtnT-Z0zD3ZWDtsJB7XeFRypRYQJTSnhgpHeF1togVHIu_869UtR3idoXRNKDJEUStoF5GX_NHaHHw3p5JuhuxGwXopNeBlKLUyX5Wft9JrSSXPl60KdkoIknh-fKBs2EodSYUXbhCJ-njmEfujTH0bV9zxJ7oE26w3LBti1Gmx5lmdy5qie16aGHQGx_jKIoxVC3Ik9x2jhgPOhWxI9lGBKB-tP_Rahfztj4sHYR6RExd390vb2s0Xd7gCC9fMisf9upuJgKdFV1OS2jnEJMHfiuDuqxOHt_IMaT1UKx9IZ9XvDCU0P-cnuE6JylndEiygQ5CFJMv6VQY3egRAlsNNMmNZX8IB_gwPYo5g54yjnJMaYNFXMnodG2edCd9AUkTi5eDa5E0HSXDbWD2TJRCZ2dsyXZ40iFcNRteC4wcyXcyiVJWcTtseeyzOzuaoV7yzV3zJoh4uCVq7PKwssWI4crcQqaAQo2S84u51tD43TOjWalx-bjx2qap3GEGrDH3Qf43wdVlUTBEmn7f_lloID58j63B53emMToq60V395Pihs17qoonIBCZXVVZYnOEednPWqJ6D0tmTOmfvmqNjAzyfCGiooCXXoy5AI_kGTQFKtb=w1157-h867-no" alt="bottles and sense"></p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RQ_TILf24Fdcu0RDO9o4HXzgkrj67B34DfGJfjqtKM_oPF96VOBl_zSTck3lm6Yd6Ng-suMGI_889Ald3_dpsP0YXn6Mtl1VGFcmzNO2WI7MUORITghNbZSbpt0yQ-rC-b-winnPEa044dgpkVdUnVbm6kUti-fb663ntR7wm2LfW-xmYq9h6isyl6msTNe8oNoHcJcEsCZVyiReiPepbk0jwuWvjfCyo7txa_eGzK-WR2A2PmxplJ01ojrHFZf-VeAJh1y7ZiaWdBW7RQGZ6dbtgHwoBpzJmyEhxh1O2DeMKc4AWbfly-_fM4tBo0rvVXKaIe8eoohGnXq7c2NWI2y_sn7WsGhLmoesdOk5CsJIKFKABnGDB03dvAksaBg5JZJNSYIROIMNnCboiv9KFmwYIkxTFc-AAKojjJolqWr7HPQqESjQBRwyoyIy2_MMCZhnAH3LSAdAUlIm8xcQNlvYrG5WiQ1h3t5J5X7D58ZfK2WxOWlZounm6mM5yP45KoMY3aMRXMS31OuBCpsCY03MQ5mQPDov0vkj-OvDN00HhK3S8uiMHJUinRq5L9_QNSPoqVXPQd8aNXVyeVjpShbe5AREJs-DGmX69rjokqKhtQa92ZTDsDyX-aUdU0RfNQi3UmJI29s7lEWD0fwT54e8E7p3gBw2oII_XjJZ-xadpj63GkhUx8azHrHW08AuoNiNepHqdlCmIxUs5JGDe_F6ZipLEL3XHgZJmZ_zATDp2r3G=w1157-h867-no" alt="hidden wealth"></p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BXZiHwwHQ44C5V4sK2eYvwX8ui4WTJminocilW3PZCHCOOVOs3rA3i9ZSU7fpGIBXek1VSUyYSXUP6dy5Sg5LVuM9a92CHDtGXQtb5LuMAORazp9YuU5LpT5P8quwRgupsxxl8Pr7XFSWAmuca3P6cCUTUZ468gO9rG2R-eUWUnYbGo-KTMK4TSEfPpIzw_UVxSLlt1xB5XNb67xHMxpGTTSynhOzbZVXFo5aFtG7D10kCKGpD-rlv4pBt1uNvKXgAUdJtJqFnyNhc6hZqKf9U__jvHMfY88m2ii32G7-mYIeFyBjmyHKktdtXS5E-Ev-LC-f-Ak-WxwB1W87D5w3Xt3f6XHQXgnoAGezHmPhYGJ31LkCfZqQU-90U0W6IITofk4JTDoAGupEsipF_gZDM6Ko3rNll4IwHh8e1uKIHEkawrz7BY-TNURDfeCiErajS7JPCkmsgu6JETPebv19B6iyVcNYTpogQpRPusMAZqW7N1i_PRcgEq5zNvvZ86hxtoL3ZrfRw93it7YbfZlA4tBMRbAy2iJlf2McHhnTiYyYU3ESMWurhGmexVhwS-ACeUCYTDxgC0c4SPloTjoOIv-rRuQprsjpWGaB85E1je7UxgkvDahI-bHtH4sy1AsZIgg7DTsAkooCqpDyZWO-BRbFwAWWXc6rWH_vRkDITTWiD5xPjkaYL_pNNWYwBKHj1DkfRvNR3q-C_oMCLKRibUWAe9Uy9Bi_RyL6sBU4txqbkJt=w1157-h867-no" alt="to live is to learn to love"></p><p>Artists sell sculptures where the streets widen, and buildings are adorned with murals. These are resorts, gaudy buildings shaped like giant boats more reminiscent of slave ships than Senegal’s ornate fishing canoes, or open air restaurants paved with blindingly blue crude mosaic tiles that capture the vibrance of the sky without all the dust. Take a trip, see the shores, never leave your island.</p><p>There are wonderful long stretches of rocky coast where we can run around from tidepool to tidepool, and behind these homes the fine, creamy sand has been replaced by the discarded remnants of construction projects, more glass and shattered tile than rock. Between rocks sit both mollusks and a Jackson Pollack of a Home Depot ceramics section. There are random empty plots of land sectioned off with stone walls, as well as strange unexplained military signs. Luxury homes butt up against small dilapidated dwellings, and unfinished construction suggests that the locals are on the way out.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0dZXzHIClfhuUWm0gudIlgel5kNtMrNmNyaSfpOXlY0zrb4H6_tHSut4dFqhP4xat39YNDbFNsH7Ee1-5Ch5dcQS24KHID4MGk3AEDO8D822b46CJuoXtpw60tqCZrpDH8NSqExnwMioYp8sCmo2yHifwfp5NhRVLFbsehR8CTnUpoxhyayTdYpzp1KjeMlgeTlS_Jx22ExnkiwkorAszcY_Lv3hzKKjRyw8BDGeh51SgJ-0QPldijBn-962cEOQMAqXy63uryRRJr0opMX93INVRDJ3x72gi5mctXS99UL0hBaL0sYGw3HYtRoFN2eEJL6Z-GoTmOzfR-7J76aojOAysj19VdAgauvOOF_sMZmzu6bCFquP74pC1OIxTUMM-YWVumeAOsqWQ1Fh8kmI8lTJR_HbhHa5hahgg_dYMKb3e9q_JUhN02IWEmLg6umQ3kqwsXu0y_KpGY39akHm6gIcN04FTGblc-JfN6FOqszNCtMZ8Z0u4FLAagUIfKZnISnmGehDGi1dPotmpeWArDpYPNtsp5YjCWPdUWNDoeJOKKQOXQ63t-_52rVAGjLwLghCbdXWJ-2YizN0FFX7jAny7_PDq7onQ6_rUtbjW0KISGTCW9kYDeZgqOrjGitnaKy6Pa0H5ouxNdwDkvsT7PczB0x6v7OTY31kqZJLgmrYh1z79tZtSNZVkdNWNe27WmO4G3cjSq4vLmhY4SxxjXmAotB-9KYcUtTMq1jtwJ7IuENM=w1059-h794-no" alt="access forbidden"></p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fwTRyFu8nOxmwnq2rMuFJcJBPLRWB9ExkW3Zr3gD_6_-0SdfFDbjae7WIWEcKM60KVJA_2QphhpqR-9bT_-HnjW2_My8jXZIvlO8CKnvFAc0nAQlTG1QZu3O1Vkj5OiNODLN8gb28_BkWUiN2xXv_KDA6aJBeotzyYoh9X6FvYErKIYLtgJaYNuyhrdUDIdVOzNr-v0_Y6DJm-b9TN0jkOfFEsAMSZOTt_cdpnN5wbtK7ILiBdcNl4DvRMDsCv24PwlRM2xazGmNIij4LGyHh4GloWDU8ShDzvQw5Q9GjXMp8uLPRqVMwFvt3qjckQTbChmisf_1dWaba6gjv00Z_KoaZcs0q_Sg5W_7xq51yHjhTP4ZzZqIrQFGUGYzC5_GeH_atAKmGpGksUAu59rao3dcjDnH3C59NtlXFQWQuHZGcBvz5bGPNOTobdYeZ8r3HD0cvSdGe4nK8H2d7_xYE2Qh_L75LnUEuhW6qhcsCMiFm058FpJDVwp-nuGKRvZa4A50MsFJEboEshZFepMJks9s7k9LVUObPm5KN89FRJXelkeQNQkKQmbq2iJdohcKRUHcZjZIrSoiglihdMS6OyqikMkDlx2PohzLwrmvLRm3hkPpS69MCZa1AvgqkpFBoymiMJIWvcjoICigbMaZpVId1PffA9VaXiEOuCVs7NW33ZgoKbAWTckmg6A13CyjTaUvBd5e5lzt5R3Xuejf_DWoyzH_BSKjiEO7NQVjXeDcpEiU=w1157-h867-no" alt="the wealth gap"></p><p>The carcass of a swimming pool (why even have one?) houses a sandy floor. Here, I made hundreds of friends. Tiny crabs, some no bigger than an ant, scurry out of tunnels which populate the ground’s surface. All at once, the hundreds of them will slowly creep out of their holes and start cleaning the beach, grain by grain. But as soon as they detect movement, they’ll retreat.</p><p>If you’re still, very still, you can crouch over their network of rooms and wait until they come back out, like little labor organizers gathering for a meeting, their claws a whirlwind of activity. Then, as your heel touches down and your leg cramps, they’ll suddenly stop, waiting for another sign of movement. Any more action will send them all scurrying back, lightning fast, into their holes.</p><p><img

alt="splish splash"></p><p>We ate lunch on a restaurant overlooking the beach, drank cocktails on lounge chairs, and laid back in the sun alternating between naps and reading. We were tourists, blissfully unaware of the city’s deeper history, not thinking of our positionality, just taking a brief holiday.</p><p>Then we were back on the boat. We walked along the beach where we met Oscar, an injured pelican who lays with the boats and eats the fish that children and tourists bring to him. Mousa, a friendly middle-aged man dressed in cargo shorts and flipflops, introduced himself to us and became our unofficial guide to the last remnant of a traditional coastal life. Four families live on this beach in that little fishing village, and four types of fish are caught here. In a mixture of French and English, he explained the various forms of fishing, noting that in recent years, the younger generation has taken over, using motorboats and diving tanks and spears. Now the older men only come out at night to let fly theirs sails and nets. Young children will often grow up to become fishermen, learning not from their fathers but merely from practice, given a net and a boat and told to try it out. When they’re old enough to take wives, they will paint a boat with their family’s colors and name it after their beloved. If there’s a divorce, they simply paint over it.</p><p>Oscar isn’t the only pelican on the beach. Four others have been domesticated and are used for fishing. They’ll fly out with the boats, circle a school of fish invisible to the fishermen, and dive, giving the fishermen the best place to launch their attacks. The fish will be brought back in and weighed, then 75% will be given to the fishermen to sell and 25% will be kept by the community. Mousa will not accept our money. Instead, we are to give it to the mosque, which will buy rice for the children who cannot feed themselves. Children are not allowed to beg here; they shouldn’t have to. Instead, they sprint up to Mousa when they see him, and the littlest ones hug my legs and ask me how I’m doing but cannot respond in turn. When he walks us to the end of the village, where taxis are allowed, he thanks us for listening and then asks for a little change, enough for a drink: “This one is for Mousa,” he says.</p></div><footer class="article-footer"><a data-url="https://peterforberg.github.io/2020/01/12/Tourist-for-a-Day/" data-id="ck5ayc4xq000090tz1big61qn" class="article-share-link">share</a></footer></div></article><article id="post-Un-Vrai-Ami" class="article article-type-post" itemscope itemprop="blogPost" data-scroll-reveal><div class="article-inner"><header class="article-header"><h2 itemprop="name"><a class="article-title" href="/2020/01/12/Un-Vrai-Ami/">Un Vrai Ami</a></h2></header><div class="article-meta"><a href="/2020/01/12/Un-Vrai-Ami/" class="article-date"><time datetime="2020-01-12T09:05:39.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">2020-01-12</time></a></div><div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>Peter Forberg</em></p><p>At Sandaga Market, the sharks eat the minnows.</p><p>Here’s the sun, setting over flat, low roofs. People do not live here; people sell. Pharmacies, hotels, restaurants, and clothing stores reign supreme, their terraces devoid of clotheslines and goat pens. When the fire goes out, there are no lamps to guide your way. It is darkness, starlit and cold, without passing dining room candles to spark alleyways, all windows converted into pull-down metal doors that eschew light and loitering. Only the passing motorbike, swerving out of sand heaps, will perforate the black streets, dust defining its cyclops headlight’s diffusion. But there is little diffusion. Even the light huddles close together, like tourists fooled by the long days now suspicious of the sudden night. Sunsets are short, daylight deceptive.</p><p>Here’s the roundabout, an infinite loop of taxi drivers shipping and receiving the day’s latest catches. Most emerge confident, vanishing into the crowd, deftly dispatching peddlers and market guides. “J’ai pas d’argent,” they say, as they enter a market.</p><p>But here are the minnows. They’re spotted even before the taxi drops them off. They’re spotted by the police officers who lounge in the traffic’s center, they’re spotted by the shoppers who know family from foreigners, and they’re spotted by the sharks, who rise with glowing smiles and hearty laughs, dollar signs in their eyes. <em>La peau blanche.</em></p><p>They will ask you all the same questions, like “where are you from?” and “can you speak any Wolof?” and “what are you looking for today?” <em>I’m just looking.</em> They’ll practice their English on you, and they’ll feign annoyance at the other peddlers who would merely offer you their goods. You’ll ask to walk slowly. You’ll ask to talk with your friends. They will keep by your side. You’ll ask to be alone. They will show you to a place where you can be alone. You will negotiate with one only to be passed off to another, who claims to be different from the first, who is bringing you to a different place than the first. You will meet one after another, each with his own charm, his own grasp on English, his own care for your needs, his own empathy. But they’ve all watched the same documentary on the Chicago Police Department, and they all glimmer with the same praise: “Tu es un vrai ami.”</p><p>Here’s what you’ll do. You’ll be speaking French for 20 minutes now to 5 different men who all want to be your guide to the market, who want to sell you nothing and just show you a shop, a shop with clothes made by the community where you will not be supporting the Chinese knock-offs on the streets. You’ll be fine, because such situations are fine for you. But your friends, who are not speaking French, will be frustrated. This is understandable. Your rapport with your salesmen will be tested by your constant codeswitching to try and communicate the situation, as well as your plan, to those following you. And then you’ll perform. Then you’ll perform the frustrated American, the one who must be rid of all of these men bombarding him, who make him anxious, who just wants to be alone and walk around the market unbothered, thinking in English and not lying in French. But then they’ll believe you. Your friends and your salesmen. And the code will switch. Suddenly, your friends will give in, allowing the salesmen to take them away, but the salesmen will give up, deciding to leave you alone. The two are incommensurable.</p><p>And here’s a man. A Senegalese man who has watched your performance. He has read your anger and knows how to cut to your core. He will stand up, dressed in subdued colors that render him a prophet, not a shyster. He will speak fluent English. He will accuse you of being insensitive. He will say, “This is how it is done in African markets. They are not being rude. They are not hassling you. They will not make you buy anything that you don’t want to buy.” They are being rude. They are hassling you. They will make you buy things that you won’t want to buy.</p><p>You will give up.</p><p>And you will ascend. You will ascend through a crowd hustlers licking their lips. You will fly past the peddlers, your guides parting the sea of swindlers and shoppers. Up three flights of stairs you will arrive in a shop of endless bright colors and magical fabrics that are stacked miles high. You will swim in a pool of hand-painted magnets. You will dance with the drums made fresh from skinned lambs. You will sport the fabrics of ancient imams. But this is not the open air market. You cannot walk away. You will see them, all the familiar faces. The many swindlers have trapped you here. The sharks are circling the minnows. The ones you spoke with, successfully ignored, will scowl at their missed meals, while those who never took to the streets will try to snatch up the ones who have lost a guide. They’re all here, swarming. They will separate you into different rooms and tell you different prices. You will make many excuses. You will bargain at your best. But they know what you’re actually paying for: you’re paying to be left alone.</p><p>You will buy an overpriced shirt that is racially insensitive.</p><p>Picture not included.</p></div><footer class="article-footer"><a data-url="https://peterforberg.github.io/2020/01/12/Un-Vrai-Ami/" data-id="ck5asobfd0000a8tz60gqgl7i" class="article-share-link">share</a></footer></div></article><article id="post-I-Know-Where-the-Missing-Socks-Go" class="article article-type-post" itemscope itemprop="blogPost" data-scroll-reveal><div class="article-inner"><header class="article-header"><h2 itemprop="name"><a class="article-title" href="/2020/01/10/I-Know-Where-the-Missing-Socks-Go/">I Know Where the Missing Socks Go</a></h2></header><div class="article-meta"><a href="/2020/01/10/I-Know-Where-the-Missing-Socks-Go/" class="article-date"><time datetime="2020-01-10T18:22:05.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">2020-01-10</time></a></div><div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>Peter Forberg</em></p><p>I know where the missing socks go. I know because I’ve found them. When you load your socks, wet and crumpled and inside-out, into the metal drum that whirs and winds with the afternoon chores, the heat is not there to warm them. The spin does not untangle them. The minutes, counting down, do not track the time until they are dry as a bone, shrunk and ready to stretch. It tracks the time until they return.</p><p>When you load your socks, they are fired off to the homes of Dakar, where they are wrapped together in a towel bindle. Then, a maid quietly brings them up to the roof, where she fills three buckets: one nearly full of suds and bubbles, another half-full and flat, and final bucket completely empty. With a forceful arm, she grabs the socks one by one, dunking them into the suds and pulling them up for air, only to squeeze and stretch and wrestle their limp fabric until they are drowned once again. After a good scrubbing, they are tossed into the second bucket to rest, se reposer, until they are grabbed by the half-dozen, then strung together like unwound strings, and wrung until they won’t give up any more water. Fine, they will give the rest to the sun and the stiff oceanic wind, filled with dust and salt, as they make tiny sails along the clothesline. But one will decide, filled with hatred for all of mankind, that it’s time to escape this endless (rinse) cycle. It will loosen itself from the pin’s grasp and let fly into the rooftops, bouncing off walls and windows until it disappears into the setting winter sun, free at last. You will watch with an unsurprised grimace as the maid chuckles at your misfortune.</p><p>You will also try, as it will become your weekly task, to replicate her motions, but your gentle hands will only tickle the socks, your forceful wrung will keep them moist, and your overzealous armful of pins and socks will surely send more of them into the air. At this, she will laugh the whole time.</p><p>At home, you will open the drum and pull out all of your socks, except for one. You will lose your sock and buy another, tossing the unmatched pair into the garbage or converting it into a dust rag or accepting that you’ll never have the right length of fabric on both ankles. You will do this many times. You will stop loading dishes in the sink and start filling every rack of the dishwasher with even the most gently used cups of water. You will look up words on your phone as the dictionaries gather dust, and you will handwrite letters only when the opportunity arises, once again searching how to write a cursive “G.” You will reread the rules of board games on the nights that the power goes out, and you’ll ask the candles if they could simply light themselves. You will press “start” on a microwave meal and ask what people used to do before technology. You will forget the names of streets in your neighborhood and become familiar only with the clear blue line that guides you to work and friends and school. Your world will become smaller, a series of connected dots, and the world beyond your window no more a map than a collection of addresses saved by search history. Entire swaths of land will be erased by movies on the backs of airplane headrests, and the bird’s eye view will start to fly blind. You will land in a new city and remember the dot that was your home. You will think of your friends but forget their movements, the tenor of their laughs, the outfits that they never wore on nights out. Instead you will have still images, fractions of the whole.</p><p>You’ll find yourself in a new climate and decide to buy new socks. You’ll put the old ones in a box with other unused clothes. They will go unsold at Goodwill and be sent all around the world. 5 years later, you’ll decide that you want to add another point and line to your map, and you will take that trip to that city on the coast in that massive continent everyone says is the next big thing. You’ll meet a man on a fishing dock who speaks no English and has no fondness for the US wearing a dusty “Hard Rock Cafe” baseball cap and two socks: one that doesn’t match the other.</p><p>Your lost socks are in Dakar, and no, I’m not going to bring them back.</p><p><em>This post is dedicated to the alleyway behind our apartment in Chicago. When we take out the trash, we have to quickly open the gate to the dumpsters and then throw away the bag before the gate closes in order to avoid getting locked out. Once, I threw away a bag and a big mess of tin foil, shaped exactly like the food it housed, escaped the bag and flew into the wind. Later, while walking to work, about 2 blocks away and obscured by buildings, that piece of tin foil flew into my back, and I threw it away.</em></p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1DW7wCihdfj0FTyEKJYUvbR8CQpdL9eq8xCeQXdZwHZgcLuNvkyifFqhzQzu-z3rz8llma2RKZ2hAP5MvwIKyAi6ve4VE-AIV0EBkkFLKfcmX4HNn3JS_BU_AOVz8E6qCyOE2zFtoKsbnU4eVvU5Kg8LEd_yqBhqEdB-RovjGkOa4WzdJwiiCvRgiCKv2X3o-ZlgrXonUFrbP4ZibAb0Tamxnc5U-KXOxAkK39iJuD4RGvdvW5Qaaa5nubfMAZgq3CujfCeTGAl56NiYlMcINbxeHVS72Lj89q6nS99e9jQYEvfWv94nl_-B7w1lo57S8RC5W9vamrwIDJefQGdGkQ0qIo8xMnUYkNPV63yGdtMPBHzHMfewVg7X4Re0GeUmi39ooVrixPCfxMys5FAnUSU4J4G1uFnmPuchYqmEQi6KmUz5RyoCuOVC_IwDo0Lp_jPwFYXaUxmPNmCPHSGmI7f5r4QeAgc-4Hqtr3t3_KQw8uuAHGkVc7w9_w9ipuFf022vHyUe0D1v8kCaBozTBcIY2vO1czN7H4Bxx_ejZXfBg7SJ-dwxFC54jmKRUz8i1Yc9RYWAf0tUGOuvqbuCwP7nX2ix8zIkd7LgecEtkk0nEgBkKde0WAu0WmpWtkpH4MRkjrZMCc4QhYwVMPp75m4et1iQtG5zyW7khF5lVEtD7hgnOXVjlWpCnGxm50TIF4jigUMJlNNGhF_Xx5W-76fI77tVsc1_J1wZbVPy5pFhHizb=w1157-h867-no" alt="my clothes, blowing in the wind" title="do you ever feel like a pair of underwear blowing in the wind"></p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iZNUAhCKRQOXHNkE09g2dKHt6eaS2NY8HXbMhydQqYnWIp3bAKO4iHPsiSpPz5Z4FbAlLI5d2W9hx2DAVfwnrvlv9HJZIYP8atFqX9Jv0LVx0L_vX5GmDkfWy4JPMHa3uK9Q82cFF7ks3hoE_6lRytjkkVJZfZB7OIuoXosP97LeRBWXVPi2ruirpqgJ0OVm7xSSXmBi-d6zW0vTe6i0MqOht0SYT8L3-F6NBkYSrOTeYHnUGUy2ODTC4R4AxMM1Dnty6IrB1P3C-_2oIYLbeTimmWlmHWvkPDWiA1rH4pbij2HPtgZ1Es4jgIfT3Y5d6JdSjsllVrbONxdfyAJWxKWxHzcjKb-ZQTUrKx2YktY33g7w_kyyws0aYXAGS1sUi4DdiCsOJkftRnHrO96r3M-ukZqir86yfY_1dFmCERw7Q63jX2ltCctgcQCZBt8QIruX8skoeVll9mhoVKjmYSdSoKVVbUS7DkiCovdepOtDZAjajQH5ko1GqkwmiAtGUQmfAuvM8owLurEna3w4fzeOiDf94z8JCpLVDyzeeZV3qzE_DMP_wGJ81TfZLTB3M6v-8R-Rw9ztZugLgbH6qmEZHz66gAdA6NXwwA-Ok8q5id9Klw-P0dcZo8iAkjW2ZjX_ZzvZaW8vOHWH_XzMZkdWD2fJzPfr3-0HXSpeY9tcnlaipdMHu2ycz4s_mKby3CkbAaA2hiFDr1TjgK2BVfdNusYHHoxJep9HavPrAx6UPhIO=w1157-h867-no" alt="my socks and undies i guess" title="look upon ye mighty and despair"></p></div><footer class="article-footer"><a data-url="https://peterforberg.github.io/2020/01/10/I-Know-Where-the-Missing-Socks-Go/" data-id="ck58hutwa0000kctzee98cgs8" class="article-share-link">share</a></footer></div></article></article><nav class="page-nav"><span class="page-number current">1</span><a class="page-number" href="/page/2/">2</a><a class="extend next" rel="next" href="/page/2/">next page</a></nav></section></div><footer class="footer"><div class="outer"><ul class="list-inline"><li>&copy; 2020 Peter Forberg &amp; Nicholas Earley</li><li></li></ul><ul class="list-inline"><li></li><li></li></ul></div></footer><div class="to_top"><div class="totop" id="totop"><i class="ri-arrow-up-line"></i></div></div></main><aside class="sidebar"><button class="navbar-toggle"></button><nav class="navbar"><div class="logo"><a href="/"><img src="/images/ayer-side.svg" alt="Peter &amp; Nick"></a></div><ul class="nav nav-main"><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-item-link" href="/">Home</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-item-link" href="/archives">Archive</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-item-link" href="/about">About</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-item-link" href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></nav><nav class="navbar navbar-bottom"><ul class="nav"><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-item-link nav-item-search" title="Search"><i class="ri-search-line"></i> </a><a class="nav-item-link" target="_blank" href="/atom.xml" title="RSS Feed"><i class="ri-rss-line"></i></a></li></ul></nav><div class="search-form-wrap"><div class="local-search local-search-plugin"><input type="search" id="local-search-input" class="local-search-input" placeholder="Search..."><div id="local-search-result" class="local-search-result"></div></div></div></aside><div id="mask"></div><div id="reward"><span class="close"><i class="ri-close-line"></i></span><p class="reward-p"><i class="ri-cup-line"></i>请我喝杯咖啡吧~</p><div class="reward-box"><div class="reward-item"><img class="reward-img" src="/images/alipay.jpg"> <span class="reward-type">支付宝</span></div><div class="reward-item"><img class="reward-img" src="/images/wechat.jpg"> <span class="reward-type">微信</span></div></div></div><script src="/js/jquery-2.0.3.min.js"></script><script src="/js/jquery.justifiedGallery.min.js"></script><script src="/js/lazyload.min.js"></script><script src="/js/busuanzi-2.3.pure.min.js"></script><script src="/fancybox/jquery.fancybox.min.js"></script><script>var ayerConfig={mathjax:!1}</script><script src="/js/ayer.js"></script><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery-modal@0.9.2/jquery.modal.min.js"></script><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery-modal@0.9.2/jquery.modal.min.css"><script type="text/javascript" src="https://js.users.51.la/20544303.js"></script></div></body>
